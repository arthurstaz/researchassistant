            Misaligned Narrative of the Ecological Role of Vachellia caven in Eastern South American Savannas
Vachellia caven is a thorny leguminous shrub to treelet, widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and spanning across the Southern Cone from Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina and Chile. Most of the contemporary research focuses on the western range of the species distribution, in Chile, though this review emphasizes the species' long-term and widespread ecological importance in the eastern range, particularly within the Pampas of Southern South America. The Pampas is one of the most threatened open vegetation ecosystems, rapidly losing native habitats due to intense conversion for agriculture and livestock production. Driven by historical land use practices and the vast areas designated for livestock, xeric and spiny vegetation has long been suppressed and actively removed, as part of pasture management strategies. This review challenges the prevailing narrative that portrays V. caven as a controversial or ambiguous species, frequently labeled as "invasive woody encroacher". This designation, often documented in regions severely affected by conversion and overgrazing, reflects a socio-economic bias that emphasizes its purported negative impact on forage production while overlooking its ecological significance. The observed woody encroachment is fundamentally perceived as a symptom of anthropogenic degradation, including the historical removal of woody vegetation and chronic overgrazing. In contrast to this exploitative view, this xeric species acts as a crucial pioneer and "nurse" plant, essential for ecological succession and for sustaining a unique assemblage of native plants and animals. It facilitates the recruitment of other woody and herbaceous species by improving microhabitat conditions, including nitrogen enrichment and enhanced soil properties. By reframing V. caven’s encroachment as an indicator of ecosystem degradation rather than species invasiveness, we challenge the prevalent narrative that supports active removal of V. caven while underestimating its natural distributional range. Recognizing this species as fundamental to Pampas’ resilience and recovery is therefore essential for effective conservation and the development of sustainable restoration strategies.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Woody encroachment is increasingly threatening savanna ecosystems, but it remains unclear how this is driven by different land tenures and management systems. In South Africa, communal land is mainly managed under continuous grazing, while commercial land is under rotational grazing. We hypothesize that woody encroachment has increased since the end of the Apartheid era in 1994, when rotational grazing systems in communal land switched to continuous grazing. To test this hypothesis, we sampled six subsites in each of three replicates of the two tenure systems in the savannah biome, South Africa, and monitored the degree of woody encroachment and effects on soil using remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), dendro-ecology, and grid-based soil analyses. The results confirmed that there has been a positive greening trend over the past 25 years in communal areas due to an increase in woody cover, particularly for tree in the 50–150 cm height class. These trees corresponded to Senegalia tree ages between 10 and 25 years. Greater woody cover in communal areas was accompanied by height-dependent elevated nutrient and organic matter concentrations that increased in the topsoils by a factor of up to 1.5, relative to the freehold systems. Isotopic analyses identified debris of C3 bushes and trees as main carbon input into the soil of communal areas, where the δ13C value of −20.1‰ was significantly lower than it was at private farms (−19.2‰). Isotopic values also indicated that this carbon input took place beyond the edges of the bush canopy. We conclude that the tenure-based management system in the communal areas has promoted woody encroachment, with the associated changes in soil properties homogenizing the savanna system.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study utilized three independent replicates (villages/farms) of two tenure systems in the Kuruman savanna biome, South Africa: communal areas (continuous grazing post-1994) and freehold farms (rotational grazing). The research aimed to test if the shift to continuous grazing in communal areas promoted woody encroachment and associated changes in soil properties.<br><br>Methods included monitoring woody cover using annual Landsat time-series (1984–2015) for NDVI trends, high-resolution octocopter images for current land cover, and grid-based soil sampling (0–10 cm) for nutrient analysis (Ca, Mg, K, Na, metals), SOC, N, and stable isotopes ($\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N).<br><br>The results confirmed the core hypothesis: communal areas showed a positive greening trend (increased NDVI) over the 25-year period, attributed to a significant increase in woody cover, particularly *Senegalia mellifera* trees in the 50–150 cm height class, dating back 10 to 25 years (coinciding with the end of Apartheid and the shift to continuous grazing). This confirms that non-adapted management practices promoted encroachment.<br><br>Regarding soil properties, communal areas with greater woody cover exhibited height-dependent elevated concentrations of nutrients and organic matter, increasing in the topsoils by up to a factor of 1.5 compared to freehold farms. Isotopic analysis further identified C3 bushes and trees as the main carbon source in communal areas (significantly lower $\delta^{13}$C values: $-20.1\textperthousand$ vs. $-19.2\textperthousand$ on private farms), demonstrating a fundamental shift from C4 grass dominance. The isotopic data also suggested that C input extended spatially beyond the immediate tree/bush canopy edges.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the tenure-based management system implemented in communal areas, specifically continuous grazing after 1994, acted as a primary local driver promoting widespread woody encroachment. This confirms the critical role of specific land management practices, rather than just global drivers like elevated CO2, in facilitating vegetation change at the regional scale.<br><br>Crucially, the study determined that this woody encroachment, while often perceived as purely detrimental (threatening livelihoods due to loss of palatable grass), resulted in ecological benefits in terms of soil quality. The increased woody cover led to the accumulation of nutrients and organic matter in the sandy Arenosols. The associated changes in soil properties, driven by C3 woody litter input, are actively homogenizing the savanna landscape structure. The paper implicitly supports the argument that encroachment driven by overgrazing does not necessarily equate to total ecosystem function loss, particularly regarding biogeochemical cycling.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Woody encroachment in savannas represents an ecological process of current global interest given its negative impact on ecosystem functioning, particularly on forage production. Traditional savanna models propose competition and niche differentiation as the main mechanisms allowing tree-grass coexistence. Demographic models, instead, propose abiotic and biotic factors as bottlenecks controlling vital rates and transitions from seeds to adult trees. The role played by domestic grazing on woody encroachment is yet controversial. Here, using a multistage tree life approach, we combine both models and evaluate the role of grazing and herbaceous vegetation on woody recruitment in a Neotropical savanna dominated by Vachellia caven, a successful and widely spread encroacher tree species. We performed three experiments to evaluate seed predation, seedling emergence and survival of V. caven by manipulating cattle grazing (grazed and ungrazed areas) and herbaceous vegetation presence (vegetated and unvegetated). Finally, we combined the results of the three experiments to estimate the probability of plant recruitment across these experimental factors. Grazing decreased seed predation by half, did not modify seedling emergence and decreased seedling survival. Herbaceous vegetation did not affect seed predation nor seedling emergence rate, but increased seedling survival. Overall, the net effect of grazing on V. caven recruitment was neutral since the increase in seed availability due to the reduction in seed predation rate was compensated by the negative effect of grazing on seedling survival. Our analysis revealed that cattle grazing and herbaceous vegetation had contrasting effects on the seed and seedling life stages. We propose that in order to restrain the early stages of encroachment, cattle grazing pressure could be managed following the seasonality of demographic tree transitions. Through rotational grazing amongst paddocks, stocking rates could be relaxed during the primary dispersal stage to maximize granivory, and then increased to enhance the chance of seedling consumption and trampling.</p>

The research was conducted in a Neotropical savanna in Entre Rios Province, Argentina, where cattle grazing is managed rotationally at a moderate stocking rate (~0.4 LU/ha).<br><br>Three experiments were performed using a split-plot design that manipulated two factors: cattle grazing (grazed vs. ungrazed exclosures) and herbaceous vegetation presence (vegetated vs. unvegetated cleared subplots). The experiments tracked different demographic stages: seed predation, seedling emergence, and seedling survival.<br><br>Key results demonstrated contrasting effects across life stages. Grazing significantly decreased seed predation by half, likely due to the reduction of herbaceous biomass serving as refuge for seed predators (granivores). However, grazing subsequently decreased seedling survival, probably due to trampling or direct consumption. Grazing had no measurable effect on seedling emergence. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation did not impact seed predation or emergence but significantly *increased* seedling survival. The authors note that this contradicts the assumption of widespread tree-grass competition and suggests the herbaceous layer might offer a protective effect (though the general hypothesis anticipated competition).<br><br>When combining these vital rates, the overall net effect of cattle grazing on *V. caven* recruitment probability was found to be neutral.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Understanding ecosystem processes is vital for developing dynamic adaptive management of human-dominated landscapes. We focus on conservation and management of the central Chilean silvopastoral savanna habitat called ‘‘espinal’’, which often occurs near matorral, a shrub habitat. Although matorral, espinal and native sclerophyllous forest are linked successionally, they are not jointly managed and conserved. Management goals in ‘‘espinal’’ include increasing woody cover, particularly of the dominant tree Acacia caven, improving herbaceous forage quality, and increasing soil fertility. We asked whether adjacent matorral areas contribute to espinal ecosystem processes related to the three main espinal management goals. We examined input and outcome ecosystem processes related to these goals in matorral and espinal with and without shrub understory. We found that matorral had the largest sets of inputs to ecosystem processes, and espinal with shrub understory had the largest sets of outcomes. Moreover, we found that these outcomes were broadly in the directions preferred by management goals. This supports our prediction that matorral acts as an ecosystem process bank for espinal. We recommend that management plans for landscape resilience consider espinal and matorral as a single landscape cover class that should be maintained as a dynamic mosaic. Joint management of espinal and matorral could create new management and policy opportunities. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study investigated ecosystem process interactions and flow between three successionally linked central Chilean habitats: matorral (dense shrub), espinal (Acacia caven savanna), and shrub espinal (espinal with shrub understory). The core goal was to determine if matorral acts as an 'ecosystem process bank' that subsidizes espinal, thereby contributing to key silvopastoral management goals: increasing *A. caven* woody cover, improving herbaceous forage, and increasing soil fertility.<br><br>The researchers adopted a non-spatially and non-temporally explicit approach, using a convex hull measure to incorporate the abundance and divergence (range) of functional traits and other ecological variables (like soil properties and disturbance factors). They collected input variables (those expected to move between habitats due to successional processes) and outcome variables (those characterizing habitat states related to management goals) across 160 plots in matorral, espinal, and shrub espinal.<br><br>The results supported the hypothesis of subsidization. Matorral exhibited the largest sets of inputs to ecosystem processes, validating its role as a potential source bank. Crucially, the shrub espinal habitat demonstrated the largest sets of positive outcomes, suggesting it is a high-functioning recipient of ecological flow. These outcomes were aligned with management objectives, contradicting the view that espinal is a degraded dead end or ecosystem process sink. This functional linkage suggests that espinal is indeed part of a viable successional pathway.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that successional habitat linkages, specifically between matorral and espinal, enhance overall landscape functioning, supporting the prediction that matorral acts as a functional ecosystem process bank for espinal. The positive outcomes observed in shrub espinal, linked to increased potential for woody reproduction and improved soil fertility, reinforce the idea that the *Acacia caven*-dominated habitat is a dynamic successional stage, not a degraded dead-end.<br><br>Based on these findings, the paper strongly recommends a radical shift in conservation and land management policy. Since the three habitats (matorral, espinal, and forest) are successional linked but currently managed separately—with matorral and espinal often treated as marginal or 'orphan' habitats—the authors propose they be considered a single landscape cover class. Maintaining them as a dynamic mosaic under joint management is viewed as essential for long-term landscape resilience. This unified approach is predicted to create new opportunities for policy implementation and conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes, moving away from fragmented management based on perceived degradation states.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Vachellia caven has a disjunct distribution at the southern cone of South America, occupying two major ranges: west of Andes (Central Chile) and east of them (mainly the South American Gran Chaco). For decades, the species has been subject to various ecological and natural history studies across its distribution, but questions concerning its origin in the western range remain unresolved. Thus far, it is unclear whether Vachellia caven was always a natural component of the Chilean forests, and "how" and "when" the species arrived in the country. In this study, we revised the dispersal syndromes of the species and contrast the two main hypotheses of dispersion to the west of Andes that have been proposed in the 90’s, namely animal versus human-mediated dispersal. For this, we reviewed all scientific literature on the species and explored the available information on morphology, genetics, fossil records and distribution patterns of closely related species. Here we illustrate how the collected evidence provides support for the human-mediated dispersal hypothesis, by including a conceptual synthesis that summarizes the outcomes of different dispersal scenarios. Lastly, and regarding the positive ecological effects this species has in the introduced area, we suggest reconsidering the (underappreciated) historical impacts of archaeophytes and rethinking the role that indigenous human tribes may have had in the dispersion of different plants in South America.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study conducts a comprehensive scoped review to investigate the origin and dispersal history of *Vachellia caven*, focusing specifically on its presence in the western range (Central Chile) versus its native eastern range (Gran Chaco). The primary methodological approach involved reviewing existing scientific literature—133 sources in total, compiled from pivotal articles and complementary searches across various topics related to historical patterns (phylogeny, fossil records, varietal morphology) and dispersal mechanisms (hydrochory, endozoochory).<br><br>The results strongly reject the vicariance hypothesis (splitting due to the Andes rising), favoring a historical long-distance dispersal event. This conclusion is based on molecular timing suggesting a relatively recent diversification (6 My BP), lack of natural fossil records in the western range before recent times, and the existence of six morphological varieties in the eastern range compared to only one (*var. caven*) in the western range. The review contrasts natural dispersal mechanisms like hydrochory and endozoochory (animal dispersal) against the human-mediated hypothesis for trans-Andean transport. While cattle are the predominant current dispersers in the west, hydrochory is deemed implausible for many Chilean hill-slope populations. Ultimately, the evidence gathered is presented to support the human-mediated dispersal hypothesis, suggesting that indigenous human tribes were responsible for bringing the species across the Andes.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the presence of *V. caven* in the western range (Chile) is best explained by a long-distance dispersal scenario, rather than a vicariant process. The accumulated evidence—spanning phylogeny, fossil records, and morphological patterns—lends robust support to the human-mediated dispersal hypothesis, thereby classifying the species as an archaeophyte (an ancient introduction) in Chile.<br><br>Crucially, the study shifts focus from merely identifying the dispersal agent to advocating for a broader conceptual re-evaluation. Acknowledging the documented positive ecological effects of *V. caven* in the area where its status is debated (Chile), the authors propose that researchers must "reconsider the (underappreciated) historical impacts of archaeophytes" and fundamentally "rethink the role that indigenous human tribes may have had in the dispersion of different plants in South America." This conclusion challenges traditional native/non-native binaries, urging recognition of the complex historical interplay between human activity, plant distribution, and resulting ecological benefits.</div>

The study also noted Bañados de Altura (high-elevation floodplains), heavy clay soils highly productive when managed through systems like Voisin or intensive rotation.<br><br>The text highlights the benefits of woody cover on soil parameters, noting that forest soil (monte) showed 7.84 ppm of phosphorus, compared to 4.80 ppm in areas cleared 26 years prior, demonstrating the role of trees in nutrient cycling (a key limiting factor in the province).<br><br>The primary 'result' of the existing land use practices is severe degradation. The author identifies the most serious issue as the lack of forage availability, directly attributing this to 'pastoreo irracional' (non-rational grazing), continuous systems, and excessive stocking rates (carga animal).<br><br>This poor management leads to 'sobrepastoreo' (overgrazing), resulting in bare soil, absence of protective litter (mantillo), and subsequent invasion by aggressive weeds and woody species (e.g., espinillos, chilcas, caraguatá). This process dramatically lowers the carrying capacity (receptividad ganadera) and causes delays in the recovery of vital winter and summer forage species. Furthermore, high stocking rates on clay soils during wet periods cause soil churning (amasado), destroying the herbaceous layer and impeding later recovery. The observed reality (Curve 'b') is a low, flattened forage production curve, far from the ideal potential (Curve 'a'), leading to low profitability and high risk for producers.</div>

This degradation process leads to a severe lack of pasture availability and reduces the reproductive success of livestock, particularly the failure of seasonal breeding programs due to inadequate forage quality and quantity.<br><br>The conference implicitly urges a shift toward rational, rotational grazing systems to maximize the potential of the natural pasture year-round (preventing the 'bache forrajero'). Furthermore, the author stresses the need for holistic resource management that includes the native forest, recognizing its importance for diversity, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation, noting that the forest, like the pasture, is currently 'aged' and requires revitalization.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study was conducted as a workshop (taller) organized by the Expanded Natural Field Livestock Board (Mesa de Ganadería sobre Campo Natural Ampliada) in Cuchilla de Laureles, Tacuarembó, involving 21 local producers and 20 technicians. The primary objective was to analyze the problem of woody encroachment (arbustización) and discuss potential solutions.<br><br>Producers reported an "incredible" increase in arbustized area, confirmed by comparisons between 1966 aerial photos and modern satellite imagery. This encroachment significantly reduces grazing surface and complicates livestock management. Ecologically, the encroachment is driven by competition between shrubs and natural pastures for key resources (water, light, nutrients). Critically, selective grazing by livestock, favoring pastures over woody species, indirectly increases the coverage and density of the shrubs.<br><br>Specific species identified in the succession include the pioneer species *Aloysia gratissima* (Cedrón del monte), followed by *Schinus longifolius* (Molle) and *Lithraea molleoides* (Aruera). Historical analysis suggested that the succession often initiated in old sheep bedding areas (dormideros de ovejas) from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The subsequent reduction in the ovine population, combined with high localized fertility in these spots, fostered the colonization by woody species.<br><br>Regarding control methods, the use of fire (quema) is a frequent local practice, although the workshop revealed that its primary goal is usually to tenderize pasture and eliminate old biomass, rather than effective shrub control. Producers testified that burning often exacerbates the situation by favoring the growth and regeneration of shrubs. This is ecologically explained by the increased fertility from ash deposits, the large and fire-resistant shrub seed bank, and the stimulation of germination by heat and smoke. Technicians unanimously advised against using fire, proposing alternatives such as controlled rotational grazing, strategic lanar/bovine ratios, chemical controls, and integrated mechanical/chemical methods.</div>

Technicians defined the problem as occurring when shrubs dominate the landscape, reduce grazing area, or are non-palatable.<br><br>While complex management strategies like dividing fields based on heterogeneity were suggested by technicians to allow for specialized technologies, these are often constrained by high costs and challenging geographical/topographical conditions in the zone.<br><br>Legal context significantly limits removal options, as the Director General Forestal (DGF) clarified that many species central to the encroachment process (*Schinus, Lithraea, Aloysia*) are considered native forest and protected by law (Law 15939/987), requiring authorization for clearance activities. <br><br>The overall conclusion highlighted the success of the technical-producer knowledge exchange but emphasized the critical need for research institutions to conduct location-specific studies to generate effective, pertinent, and sustainable management alternatives that address the area’s unique environmental and socio-economic particularities.</div>

Such pods collected during the spring of 1999 in Chile were indehiscent with highly sclerified pod walls. In contrast, persistent pods collected in Uruguay after a wet winter and spring (2002) were partially dehiscent, inducing the deterioration of the woody pods, and consequently exposing the seeds. These persistent pods are a natural refuge for insect species, namely two bruchid beetles (Pseudopachymeria spinipes, Stator furcatus), one scolytidae (Dendroctonus sp), lepidopterous larvae, ant colonies (Camponotus sp), one species of oophagous parasitoid (Uscana espinae goup senex), the gregarious larval-pupae parasitoid Monoksa dorsiplana (Pteromalidae) and two species of Horismenus spp.(Eulophidae). The patriline of M. dorsiplana is frequently formed by 1 son + 7 daughters.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study investigated the biodiversity of insects associated with *Acacia caven* persistent pods, comparing samples from Chile (1997, dry period, resulting in indehiscent pods) and Uruguay (2002, wet period, resulting in partially dehiscent pods). Pods were collected during spring (November) and monitored in a controlled environment (30°/20°C thermoperiod).<br><br>The results highlighted significant differences based on pod condition. Chilean pods were longer (mean 5.4 cm), indehiscent, and only yielded the specialized bruchid *Pseudopachymeria spinipes*. About 68% of these pods were attacked, but the emergence holes significantly underestimated the population size, suggesting most bruchids utilized the same initial exit hole. Uruguayan pods were shorter (mean 2.7 cm), partially dehiscent due to climatic deterioration, and supported a much more diverse entomofauna.<br><br>Uruguayan samples showed contamination by a second bruchid species, *Stator furcatus* (in 24% of pods), along with a scolytid (*Dendroctonus sp*), lepidopterous larvae, and ant colonies (*Camponotus sp*). The total bruchid attack in Uruguay was high, destroying 82% of the seeds. Notably, *S. furcatus* exhibited multi-adult development per seed (1 to 3 adults), unlike the specialized *P. spinipes* (one adult per seed).<br><br>Three groups of parasitoids were identified: the oophagous *Uscana espinae group senex*, and the gregarious larval-pupae parasitoids *Monoksa dorsiplana* (Pteromalidae) and *Horismenus spp.* (Eulophidae). The emergence of 810 parasitoids from 285 seeds confirmed their gregarious larval development. Laboratory studies on *M. dorsiplana* using a substitution host revealed that the most frequent patriline resulting from a single host attack was 1 male and 7 females.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that persistent pods of *A. caven* function as a crucial 'natural refuge' for a varied entomofauna, including seed predators (bruchids) and their natural enemies (parasitoids). The degree of pod dehiscence, influenced critically by climatic conditions (wet vs. dry winters), determines the specific insect guild able to colonize the seeds.<br><br>Indehiscent pods collected during dry conditions primarily restrict access to specialized bruchids like *P. spinipes*. Conversely, wet conditions lead to partially dehiscent and deteriorated pods, allowing secondary infiltration by generalized bruchids like *S. furcatus* and other insects. This deterioration facilitated massive seed destruction (82% attack rate) in the Uruguayan samples.<br><br>Significantly, the persistent pods, whether indehiscent or partially dehiscent, serve as a 'significant stock of adults' for bruchid beetles. These emerging adults are then able to infect the new, developing green pods in the following season. This mechanism provides a direct infestation pathway, bypassing the previously recognized necessity of seed transit through the digestive tract of mammals for seed exposure, thereby highlighting the ecological importance of persistent pods in sustaining both pest and beneficial insect populations.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">This book summarizes the current status of scientific and management knowledge regarding global rangelands and the major challenges that confront them. It originated from discussions to update the well-received book entitled Grazing Management: An Ecological Perspective that was first published in 1991. However, it became apparent that rangeland science had advanced so rapidly in the 25 years since this book had been published that its scope was no longer sufficient to accommodate the newly created knowledge. Consequently, it was decided that a new book with an expanded scope and greater relevance to contemporary rangeland challenges was required. This book also assesses why these major advances occurred so rapidly following a half century of limited conceptual change. Major advances have primarily been represented by scientific contributions such as nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory, but socio-political events, including new policy and increasing societal demand for rangeland services, have also been important.

Collectively, this book represents an attempt to achieve these broader and more contemporary objectives by emphasizing three major themes. The first summarizes recent conceptual advances for rangeland science and management. The second addresses the implications of these conceptual advances with respect to management recommendations and policy decisions. The third evaluates some of the major challenges confronting global rangelands in the twenty-first century. This book is intended to complement applied range management textbooks by evaluating the conceptual foundation of the profession and recommending changes to promote future development and greater effectiveness.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The volume, *Rangeland Systems: Processes, Management and Challenges*, was developed to replace and expand upon the 1991 book *Grazing Management: An Ecological Perspective*. The need for this new work arose from the rapid conceptual advances in rangeland science over 25 years, particularly the adoption of theories like nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory, alongside shifting socio-political contexts.<br><br>The book is structured around three major themes corresponding to three primary sections. The first section, **Processes**, focuses on recent conceptual advances in ecological knowledge concerning the function and dynamics of rangeland systems. Specific chapter topics include **woody plant encroachment**, ecohydrology, soil processes, structural heterogeneity, nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory, and climate change consequences.<br><br>The second section, **Management**, details advances stemming from this new ecological knowledge, adopting a broad scope that considers landscape and regional scales, not just smaller 'pasture' scales. This section features chapters on rangelands as **social-ecological systems**, state-and-transition models, livestock production systems, adaptive management, and wildlife–livestock interactions.<br><br>The final section, **Challenges**, addresses high-profile, emerging issues impacting the provision of ecosystem services. These include **invasive plant species** and novel systems, ecosystem services and human demand, climate change adaptation, monitoring protocols, and rangeland systems in developing nations. The overarching methodological goal is to consolidate these diverse and complex concepts into a readily accessible volume to inform professionals, stakeholders, and policy makers, moving the field beyond traditional, narrowly framed approaches.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The core conclusion of the volume is that a more comprehensive conceptual framework is mandatory for effectively addressing the complex, contemporary challenges confronting global rangelands in the twenty-first century. Traditional range management methods have proven insufficient, primarily due to intensifying global pressures such as rapid human population growth, climate change, landscape fragmentation, and biodiversity loss.<br><br>The editor argues that previous approaches frequently failed because they either ignored complex problems or incorrectly reduced them to 'simple' problems addressable only through narrowly framed solutions. To overcome this failure, the book advocates for a fundamental shift: rangelands must be re-envisioned as integrated **social-ecological systems**.<br><br>This framework requires equal consideration of societal values, goals, and capacities alongside established ecological processes. By adopting this comprehensive approach, management agencies, educational institutions, research programs, and policy-making bodies can develop more effective strategies to assess the intricate nature of contemporary rangeland issues and develop appropriate, sustainable solutions.</div>

y sobre variables microclimáticas, en un sistema silvopastoril con espino (Acacia caven). Para ello se estableció un ensayo con cuatro
tratamientos de cobertura arbórea (0%, 30% - 40%, 50% - 60%, > 70%), en un diseño experimental de bloques aleatorizados completos
y tres repeticiones. Además de variables relacionadas con la productividad y calidad de la pradera, mediante sensores se realizó la medición
permanente de temperatura y humedad de suelo, temperatura ambiente y humedad relativa. El periodo de análisis incluye dos temporadas
de crecimiento de la pradera. Para los análisis estadísticos se consideraron tres modelos; i) la cobertura arbórea sobre la productividad de
la pradera; ii) la cobertura arbórea sobre las variables microclimáticas y iii) la cobertura arbórea sobre la productividad pratense,
considerando las variables microclimáticas como covariables. Los resultados indican que, en la segunda temporada, la mayor
productividad se alcanzó con el tratamiento sin presencia de árboles (0%). No se detectó efecto de la cobertura arbórea sobre la calidad
de la pradera, ni sobre variables microclimáticas, para los periodos evaluados. Las variables microclimáticas que mejor explicaron el
desarrollo de la pradera fueron la humedad relativa mínima y la temperatura ambiente. Transcurridas dos temporadas de crecimiento, no
es factible dilucidar aún cuál tratamiento genera las mejores condiciones para la productividad de la pradera, por lo que se hace necesario

The experiment utilized a randomized complete block design with three repetitions, testing four distinct tree cover treatments: 0% (total removal), 30% - 40%, 50% - 60%, and > 70%. The tree cover percentages were established via selective cutting of trees or stumps. Data collection spanned two prairie growth seasons (September–December 2014 and September 2015–February 2016).<br><br>Variables measured included pasture productivity (PP), determined as total dry weight per hectare derived from samples harvested from 0.5 m² exclusion cages, and pastoral value (VP), calculated based on botanical composition and specific index values (IE). Microclimatic variables—soil temperature and moisture at 15 cm depth, ambient temperature, and relative humidity at 1.3 meters—were continuously recorded using sensors. Statistical analyses involved three models: assessing the effect of tree cover on 1) pasture productivity, 2) microclimatic variables, and 3) pasture productivity using microclimatic variables as covariates.<br><br>## Results<br>The results, after analyzing two growing seasons, indicated that the highest pasture productivity was achieved in the treatment with no trees (0% cover) during the second season. This finding contrasts with historical regional studies cited in the introduction, which generally show increased productivity under canopy projection. Importantly, the study found no significant effect of tree cover on either the quality of the pasture (Pastoral Value) or the measured microclimatic variables across the evaluated periods. The microclimatic factors that showed the strongest correlation with pasture development were minimum relative humidity and ambient temperature.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The primary conclusion is that after only two growing seasons, the data are inconclusive regarding which tree cover treatment (including total tree removal) generates the best overall conditions for long-term pasture productivity and sustainability in this silvopastoral system. While the short-term results favored the 0% tree cover treatment for productivity in the second season, this was not robust enough to suggest an optimal management strategy.<br><br>The authors highlight that, contrary to expectations based on previous literature, the different tree cover levels did not significantly impact either the quality of the pasture or the measured microclimatic variables within the two-year period. This suggests that the management impacts on the microenvironment require a longer time frame to become detectable. Consequently, the authors strongly recommend continuing the measurement process to gather more stable and long-term data necessary for developing sustainable management protocols for this crucial resource.</div>

In Chile, it spans approximately 1,500 km (27º to 38º S), occupying vast areas (around 3.8 million hectares) of the central semi-arid zone. The species is characterized as a thorny tree or shrub, highly adapted to prolonged drought and poor, eroded soils, possessing a strong, extended root system suitable for erosion control.<br><br>*   **Ecological Formation and Degradation:** *A. caven* is the dominant species in the 'Espinal' (or *estepa de espino*), a characteristic formation of the Sclerophyllous Forest type. Critically, the text emphasizes that the Espinal is largely a **secondary formation** and a result of human intervention. According to various cited authors, the Espinal represents a degradation of a more evolved climax community (*Lithraea caustica* or *Quillaja saponaria*) or is a direct consequence of chronic human intervention, including wood harvesting and overgrazing.<br><br>*   **Human Impact:** The species is under intense exploitation. Historically dense xerophytic forests in the Central Valley have been severely reduced due to 'tala constante y permanente' (constant and permanent logging) for firewood and charcoal, and large areas have been cleared for agriculture (especially vineyards and olive groves) in the Valparaíso and Libertador Bernardo O’Higgins regions, leading to the current prevalence of multi-stemmed, shrub-like individuals rather than full trees.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The methodology employed for constructing this technical guide was participatory, involving an expert workshop held in October 2019, organized by the Nexo Pampa and PANexus projects. The workshop gathered 10 participants (researchers, specialists, students, and managers) from key regional institutions (UFRGS, Embrapa, Sema/RS, ICMBio partners) who used a semi-structured questionnaire and discussion to define the sequential stages and processes for native grassland restoration. The resulting preliminary guide was then evaluated individually by invited experts and tested as an orientation protocol by the Secretariat of the Environment and Infrastructure of Rio Grande do Sul (Sema/RS) before final adjustments.<br><br>The guide outlines a four-stage process for ecological restoration focusing exclusively on the biotic component of Campos Sulinos ecosystems, excluding cases of extreme soil degradation (like post-mining).<br><br>**Stage 1: Local Diagnosis.** This crucial step involves evaluating the area's resilience (its capacity for natural regeneration), historical land use (e.g., intense agriculture vs. overgrazing vs. silviculture), and landscape context (presence of native remnants nearby). Higher use intensity and duration correspond to lower resilience, specifically due to the reduction of critical underground structures (rhizomes) and native seed banks. The diagnosis determines the necessary degree of active intervention.<br><br>**Stage 2: Establishment of Grassland Vegetative Cover.** Based on the diagnosis, strategies are chosen. For low-resilience areas (often following intensive agriculture), active introduction of native herbaceous species is necessary. Soil preparation is generally discouraged if the soil structure is intact (e.g., previously managed with no-till farming), as it promotes the entry of undesirable species. Fertilization is also advised against. When seeding, native species are preferred; if unavailable, non-invasive exotic forage species (like black oat or ryegrass) may be used temporarily. Critically, known invasive species like *Eragrostis plana* (capim-annoni) must be avoided, and targeted herbicide application or mowing may be required to control invasives.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Durante a 10ª Conferência das Partes da Convenção sobre Diversidade Biológica (COP-10), realizada em 2010, na cidade de Nagoya, Província de Aichi, Japão, foi aprovado um Plano Estratégico com 20 metas, conhecidas como Metas de Aichi. Este plano estabelece ações para diminuição da perda da biodiversidade no mundo, fazendo com que os 193 países signatários, incluindo o Brasil, se comprometam a trabalhar juntos para implementar as 20 metas propostas até 2020.
A Meta 11 desse Plano Estratégico estabelece que, até 2020, pelo menos 17% de áreas terrestres e de águas continentais e 10% de áreas marinhas e costeiras terão que ser conservadas por meio de sistemas de áreas protegidas. Estas áreas têm que ser ecologicamente representativas, satisfatoriamente interligadas e integradas em paisagens terrestres e marinhas mais amplas. Outras medidas de conservação complementares devem ser também planejadas.
Para alcançar as metas da COP-10, terão que ser revistas muitas de nossas ações e construídas políticas públicas eficientes dos pontos de vista ambiental, social e econômico. Muitos modelos atuais de desenvolvimento econômico não respeitam a capacidade de renovação dos sistemas ecológicos, intensificando as alterações ambientais (UNDP, 1992) e contribuindo para a redução da qualidade de vida das sociedades humanas (WCED, 1987).
Entre as principais consequências do desenvolvimento de atividades humanas destacam-se a perda e fragmentação de áreas naturais, estando estas entre as principais ameaças à biodiversidade em todo o mundo. Provocam declínio da diversidade biológica, alterações nas comunidades biológicas e empobrecimento de interações ecológicas (Primack & Rodrigues, 2001; Cerqueira et al., 2003; Fahrig, 2003; Watling & Donnelly, 2006).
A criação e implantação de unidades de conservação (UCs) tem sido uma das ferramentas mais efetivas de conservação da biodiversidade (Bensusan, 2006). Os objetivos das UCs vão desde a proteção integral da biodiversidade e de ecossistemas até o manejo sustentável de recursos naturais específicos, sendo importantes também as possibilidades de turismo em contato com a natureza, educação e sensibilização ambiental e realização de pesquisas científicas (Milano, 1997a,b).
Entretanto, as UCs brasileiras ainda estão longe de cumprirem seus objetivos de forma eficiente e, em seu conjunto, não estão integradas como sistema. Entre os principais problemas estão a falta de regularização fundiária de suas áreas, falta de pessoal capacitado, situações institucionais ainda precárias, processos distorcidos de elaboração e implementação de planos de manejo, além da pequena cobertura territorial e falta de conectividade entre áreas similares (Milano, 1997a).
Nesse sentido, é muito importante que as áreas protegidas estejam integradas a diferentes estratégias de manejo, incluindo o fortalecimento das zonas de amortecimento das UCs e implantação de corredores. Para que as zonas de amortecimento cumpram efetivamente suas funções, as atividades realizadas em seu interior devem aliar preservação ambiental, questões sociais e atividades econômicas (Morsello, 2001), interligando-se ao desenvolvimento de sua região, tanto para obterem reconhecimento público como para possibilitar a construção de alianças em seu favor (IUCN, 1993).
O Projeto Conservação da Biodiversidade como Fator de Contribuição ao Desenvolvimento do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul/Brasil (Projeto RS Biodiversidade) tem como objetivos a conservação da biodiversidade e a integração do setor produtivo com as ações de conservação e recuperação em áreas prioritárias, garantindo a função, a dinâmica e a evolução dos ecossistemas naturais. O Projeto deve fomentar, também, a conscientização sobre a biodiversidade e o desenvolvimento de instrumentos de gestão para o manejo eficiente e sustentável dos recursos naturais.
Até o momento, o Rio Grande do Sul conta com 34 UCs federais e estaduais. Destas, 27 são de proteção integral (onde não é permitida a exploração direta dos recursos) e sete de uso sustentável (onde é possível o uso racional dos recursos). As UCs federais e estaduais totalizam uma área aproximada de 721.666 ha, o que representa somente 2,56% de toda a superfície do Estado. O Parque Estadual do Espinilho (PEEsp), com uma área de 1.617 ha, é a única UC no Brasil que protege a vegetação Savana tipo Parque, que no país está restrita ao extremo oeste do Rio Grande do Sul.
Por sua importância e singularidade, a área da Formação Parque Espinilho é considerada pelo MMA (2007) como de extrema importância biológica e prioritária para a conservação de muitas espécies de flora e fauna de importância regional, nacional e global. Destaca-se, também, pela ocorrência de campos naturais, com uma vasta variedade de gramíneas ameaçadas pela ação antrópica local. Nesse contexto, a integração entre conservação e os distintos usos realizados nas propriedades particulares da região são de grande relevância.
Para atuar na região, no conjunto do Projeto RS Biodiversidade, foram planejadas propostas de ação visando à “Restauração e Conservação dos Ecossistemas do Entorno do Parque Estadual do Espinilho”, com o intuito de sugerir novas formas de desenvolvimento que viabilizem a conservação de espécies ameaçadas. Ao mesmo tempo, devem ser consideradas as especificidades locais históricas, sociais e culturais, de forma a possibilitar o desenvolvimento econômico e a sustentabilidade de ambientes naturais a partir da percepção e valorização da biodiversidade e do ecossistema.</p>

To identify environmental problems, threats, and opportunities, the authors conducted research and facilitated workshops that consulted stakeholders from 12 institutions, including municipal, state, and federal public bodies, research institutions, NGOs (Brazilian and Uruguayan), class entities, and public school teachers. Rural landowners directly within the Buffer Zone were also sought as potential partners.<br><br>A key workshop held in August 2013 in Barra do Quaraí solidified technical proposals and identified actors for implementation. The participants were divided into four groups, each focusing on a specific goal: (1) resolution of contamination and environmental degradation, (2) improved territorial planning for conservation, (3) implementation of research, education, and training, and (4) diversification of activities and production methods on local properties. The strategies were designed to be easily assimilated and sustainable, ensuring their continuity after the conclusion of the RS Biodiversity Project.<br><br>### Results<br><br>The discussions yielded four sets of crucial problems/goals and six subsequent strategic actions. Key problems identified included inadequate municipal waste disposal, illegal entry and application drift of agrochemicals (linked to extensive rice farming), poaching/abigeato, and roaming domestic animals. Territorial planning needed improvement, specifically the creation of biological corridors, full PEEsp land regularization, and the planned ordering of Legal Reserves (RLs) on private land. Research was deemed necessary to monitor exotic species (like *capim-annoni*, cervo-axis, and wild boar) and to assess the impact of the BR-472 highway on local fauna.<br><br>The resulting strategic actions defined were:<br><br>1.  **Establishing Connectivity:** Utilizing Legal Reserves (RLs) and ensuring compliance with environmental laws (like CAR registration) to establish vegetation fragments and biological corridors linking the PEEsp to external, important conservation areas.<br>2.  **Economic Diversification:** Creating and commercializing regional products, especially crafts, to diversify income associated with environmental conservation.<br>3.  **Ecotourism Development:** Expanding and organizing bird watching tourism, capitalizing on the area’s singular species diversity.<br>4.  **Addressing Rice Farming Impacts:** Combating the irregular entry of agrochemicals from Uruguay, strictly enforcing rules on aerial application, and identifying production systems more compatible with the environment.<br>5.  **Strengthening Park Management:** Concluding expropriation payments to fully regularize PEEsp’s land area and establishing a Consultative Council to involve diverse sectors of society in park management.<br>6.  **Improving Visitation Infrastructure:** Structuring the park for visitors, emphasizing that UCs can act as factors of development if planned as integrated economic potentials.</div>

The authors argue that Conservation Units (UCs), even those of integral protection, can function as catalysts for development—especially through regulated tourism and related economic activities—if properly planned and linked to local sectors. This aligns with the thesis that socio-economic bias drives negative perceptions of native ecosystems.<br><br>To achieve sustainability, the defined strategies focus on institutional strengthening (completing land payments and creating participatory councils), establishing essential ecological connectivity through biological corridors on private land via Legal Reserve management, and mitigating severe anthropogenic threats. Major threats include contamination from the intensive rice farming sector and the spread of invasive exotic species. Ultimately, the success of the conservation efforts hinges on fostering a regional perception that values and integrates the unique biodiversity of the Espinilho formation as an asset for sustainable development.</div>

As a planning document rather than a traditional academic paper, it does not contain a formal abstract. Its primary purpose is to outline the legal, physical, biotic, socioeconomic, and managerial context necessary for the implementation and sustainable operation of the Conservation Unit (UC).

The plan details the rationale for creating the park within the Pampa biome, focusing on the protection of the unique Savanna (Espinilho) formation. It includes comprehensive characterizations of the regional context, geophysics, climate, flora, and fauna, culminating in the definition of a detailed Zoning scheme (Zona Intangível, Zona Primitiva, Zona de Uso Extensivo, etc.) and specific Management Programs (Protection, Community Integration, Research, and Monitoring) necessary to achieve conservation objectives.</p>

It details the geopolitical, demographic, and economic context of the surrounding region, emphasizing the challenges related to land use (Agropecuária and Comércio) and socioeconomic indicators (IDESE). The rationale (Justificativas) for establishing the park is provided, underscoring the critical need to conserve the characteristic ecosystem of the Espinilho formation.<br><br>### Environmental Characterization<br>Sections 4 through 9 provide a detailed characterization of the physical and biotic environment. This includes analyses of regional and local geomorphology, geology (mentioning the Paraná Basin, Botucatu, and Serra Geral formations), hydrogeology (Aquífero Guarani), pedology (Chernossolos, Vertissolos), and climate (Precipitation and Temperature data). Crucially, the biotic sections detail the **FLORA DO PARQUE** (Section 8), specifically classifying the dominant vegetation as **Formação de Savana** (8.1) and **Floresta Estacional Semidecidual Submontana** (Mata Ciliar, 8.2). The Savanna formation is noted as being typically dominated by *Prosopis affinis* (inhanduvaí) and *Prosopis nigra* (algarrobo), alongside *Acacia caven* (espinilho).<br><br>### Degradation and Management Implications<br>A significant visual finding (Figure 31) documents the historical land management practice of **actively removing** woody vegetation, showing a concrete roller used to suppress *Prosopis* and *Acacia caven* trees. This highlights the historical suppression of the woody component in favor of cattle pasture. Subsequent sections establish the **Zoneamento** (Zoning, Section 10) of the park into areas requiring different levels of protection (e.g., Zona Intangível, Zona Primitiva, Zona de Recuperação [ZR]), and mandate specific **Programas de Manejo** (Section 11) for protection, community engagement, and scientific research and monitoring. The inclusion of **Zona de Recuperação** (ZR) suggests areas impacted by past anthropogenic activities (such as abandoned rice paddies mentioned in Figure 37) need active restoration.</div>

It details the necessity of demarcating the park limits, identifying critical points, establishing vigilance bases, and implementing fire prevention controls under the **Programa de Proteção**.<br><br>### Socio-Environmental Integration and Research<br>Crucial programs are outlined for fostering positive relationships with the local community (Programa de Integração com a Comunidade), including environmental awareness campaigns and the establishment of a consultative council. Furthermore, the **Programa de Pesquisa, Monitoramento e Manejo** emphasizes the need for ongoing scientific study of the ecosystem, including systematic monitoring of biodiversity (amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) and environmental parameters. The final zoning scheme ensures that areas critical for the **Savana formation** and other habitats receive maximum protection (Zona Intangível and Primitiva), while allowing for limited, controlled use (Zona de Uso Extensivo and Intensivo) compatible with the park's conservation goals. The presence of the *Acacia caven* formation (Espinilho) is the defining element of the park's conservation value, directly contradicting the narrative that the species is solely a weed or encroacher, and instead positioning it as fundamental to the endemic ecosystem.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study aims to provide scientific grounding by investigating the history of human occupation and the evolution of botanical and phytogeographical knowledge concerning the Espinilho State Park (Pontal do Quaraí, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil).<br><br>The regional history begins with Indigenous Pampeanos (Charruas, Minuanos) followed by Jesuit settlements in the 17th century, culminating in the vast Estância de Japeju (1660), which introduced large numbers of cattle. The region later came under Portuguese/Brazilian control (early 1800s) and experienced a period where the cattle population multiplied freely after the Jesuits were expelled.<br><br>The authors delineate two main economic cycles impacting the region. The first, focused on agro-pastoralism and the charque (dried meat) industry, peaked around 1887 with the establishment of the "Saladeiro Barra do Quaraí." This cycle relied heavily on native fields and natural parks for grazing, and its environmental impact was deemed "relatively small" compared to the subsequent period.<br><br>The first cycle declined in the 1930s due to the rise of frigoríficos and protective federal legislation (Lei Federal de Desnacionalização do Charque, 1927). It was immediately followed by a second, highly transformative economic cycle: irrigated rice agriculture. Beginning around 1937, this activity expanded rapidly, driven by favorable conditions (flat lands, abundant water from the Uruguai and Quaraí rivers, and accessible transportation). This expansion caused the "drastic modification" of the landscape and the "suppression of great part of the native fields and arboreal vegetation of the natural parks."<br><br>Crucially, the authors note that the preservation of this unique natural heritage, specifically the *inhanduvá* (Nandubaysal) and *algarrobo* (Algarrobal) parks, was only secured through legal protections (Decree 42.099/2002 for *inhanduvá*) and the creation of the Parque Estadual do Espinilho (1975).</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study establishes that the Pontal do Quaraí region has undergone profound historical changes linked directly to land use practices. The initial centuries of extensive cattle ranching, while significant, exerted a comparatively low environmental pressure on the native fields and arboreal vegetation, as these were integral to the pastoral economy.<br><br>The true and drastic environmental modification occurred with the transition to intensive monoculture—specifically irrigated rice farming—starting in the late 1930s. This agricultural expansion led to the widespread suppression of the native *campos* and the arboreal 'natural parks,' which represent a unique ecological heritage of Rio Grande do Sul.<br><br>The final conclusion is an implicit plea for the recognition and protection of this unique ecosystem. The authors state that without the legal creation of the Parque Estadual do Espinilho and the protection of species like *inhanduvá*, the state would likely have lost the Nandubaysal and Algarrobal parks, reinforcing the view that modern, intensive land conversion poses the existential threat to these native woody formations, rather than natural ecological processes or species invasiveness.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Vachellia caven is a thorny leguminous shrub to treelet, widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and spanning across the Southern Cone from Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina and Chile. Most of the contemporary research focuses on the western range of the species distribution, in Chile, though this review emphasizes the species' long-term and widespread ecological importance in the eastern range, particularly within the Pampas of Southern South America. The Pampas is one of the most threatened open vegetation ecosystems, rapidly losing native habitats due to intense conversion for agriculture and livestock production. Driven by historical land use practices and the vast areas designated for livestock, xeric and spiny vegetation has long been suppressed and actively removed, as part of pasture management strategies. This review challenges the prevailing narrative that portrays V. caven as a controversial or ambiguous species, frequently labeled as "invasive woody encroacher". This designation, often documented in regions severely affected by conversion and overgrazing, reflects a socio-economic bias that emphasizes its purported negative impact on forage production while overlooking its ecological significance. The observed woody encroachment is fundamentally perceived as a symptom of anthropogenic degradation, including the historical removal of woody vegetation and chronic overgrazing. In contrast to this exploitative view, this xeric species acts as a crucial pioneer and "nurse" plant, essential for ecological succession and for sustaining a unique assemblage of native plants and animals. It facilitates the recruitment of other woody and herbaceous species by improving microhabitat conditions, including nitrogen enrichment and enhanced soil properties. By reframing V. caven’s encroachment as an indicator of ecosystem degradation rather than species invasiveness, we challenge the prevalent narrative that supports active removal of V. caven while underestimating its natural distributional range. Recognizing this species as fundamental to Pampas’ resilience and recovery is therefore essential for effective conservation and the development of sustainable restoration strategies.</p>

This process had an intermediate step in which sclerophyll species were replaced by Acacia caven, prior to cattle grazing. This land use change presents environmental impacts resulting from carbon losses of ecosystems. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of A. caven on the physical properties of soil. The study was conducted in two sites of central Chile (Pirque and Peñuelas). Soil samples were taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm with and without A. caven cover. Organic matter, bulk density, pore size distribution and aggregate stability were evaluated. A marked difference was found in terms of depth in both study sites, also observing a process of densification of the subsurface horizon. A. caven cover has beneficial effects on the soil because it produces increased organic matter, decreased bulk density, and a higher proportion of coarse pores compared to soils without A. caven. However, available water holding capacity was higher in the site that had no influence of A. caven in Pirque. A. caven cover also promotes less mechanical resistance and higher structural stability, so that it is a good alternative to specific site protection towards the restoration of sclerophyll forest.</p>

The main objective was to quantify the effects of *A. caven* cover on soil physical properties one year after grazing exclusion was established.<br><br>The research took place at two sites: Pirque (loamy clay-sandy) and Peñuelas (franco limosa), both historically subject to grazing (bovines, equines, and camelids). Soil samples were collected from four exclusion plots at two depths (0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) in two positions: under the canopy projection (BE) and outside the canopy (FE). Measured parameters included organic matter (MO), bulk density, pore size distribution, aggregate stability, and resistance to shear strength.<br><br>Results demonstrated a marked difference in properties based on depth, noting a general process of densification in the subsurface horizon (10–20 cm). Crucially, MO content was significantly higher in the surface horizon (0–10 cm) and consistently greater under *A. caven* cover (BE) compared to open areas (FE), attributed to extra litter input. The presence of *A. caven* cover led to numerous beneficial effects on soil structure: decreased bulk density, increased total porosity, and a higher proportion of coarse pores (PDR, rapid drainage pores). This structural improvement resulted in lower mechanical resistance and greater structural stability (lower dispersion ratio).

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Currently, many regions of the world are under-sampled, which means our knowledge about biodiversity has gaps. Many studies proposed methods to identify areas for new specimen sampling; however, none considered the application of spatial constraints for this prioritization, which does not consider logistical issues. Here, we propose an approach to identify priority areas for new specimen sampling, considering distributional aspects based on species distribution models and kernel density estimation for species occurrences. We also used different species weights (e.g., endemicity degree) and spatial constraints (e.g., proximity to roads or land cover). Our method applies to one or several species since our approach separately considers the interaction between the distribution and density of occurrences of each species. We used the Gran Chaco biome as the study area and Leguminosae as a target species group to exemplify the use of our approach. We verified that Gran Chaco presents low sample coverage. Paraguay and Bolivia should be prioritized for new samples, especially considering the endemicity degree of the species. The Gran Chaco is one of the most extensive formations of dry forests on the planet and one of the regions with the highest levels of deforestation, exposing the urgency of field research in the region. Our approach identifies conserved priority areas for new specimen sampling accessible through roads, with a low density of occurrences and high suitability for different species. Our method will help scientists in the field work, reducing costs and facilitating the planning to prioritize regions for new specimen sampling.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors propose a method to prioritize areas for new specimen sampling by combining species suitability (derived from Species Distribution Models, SDMs) and species occurrence density (Kernel Density Estimation, KDE). The core equation prioritizes areas of high suitability and low occurrence density, which can be further weighted by species characteristics such as endemicity degree.<br><br>A crucial innovation of the approach is the inclusion of spatial constraints (Section 2.2) to ensure logistical feasibility and ecological relevance. These constraints include proximity to roads (up to 5 km), a high proportion of natural cover (C > 80%), and focusing on unprotected regions. The study notes that ignoring these spatial constraints might result in prioritizing inaccessible or deforested areas. For the empirical application, the study focused on Leguminosae species within the Gran Chaco biome. Four different SDM modeling protocols were implemented based on the number of occurrences available for each species, utilizing spatial filtering to account for inherent sampling biases.<br><br>The results indicated that the Gran Chaco biome suffers from low sample coverage (Wallacean shortfall). Specifically, Paraguay and Bolivia were identified as high-priority areas, especially when prioritizing based on species endemicity. The final outcome is the identification of conserved priority areas that are accessible, possessing low existing occurrence density, and high biological suitability, thus making fieldwork more cost-effective and efficient.</div>

This method effectively addresses the biodiversity crisis by directing scientists to critical, yet under-sampled, areas, thereby reducing the Wallacean shortfall.<br><br>The authors highlight the extreme urgency of field research in the Gran Chaco, noting it is one of the world's most extensive dry forests but also one of the regions experiencing the highest levels of deforestation. This degradation necessitates targeted efforts to document biodiversity before it is lost. By identifying conserved priority areas that are also accessible, the proposed approach ensures that research efforts are focused on regions most prone to anthropic pressure (like agricultural expansion) but still contain natural cover, ultimately reducing the costs and facilitating the planning required for comprehensive biological inventorying.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">In environments with high ﬁre frequency the impoverishment of abiotic resources may favour male sexual expression in plants as it is less costly than female expression. Also, ﬁre can modify pollinator communities and thus affect plant reproduction. Here we evaluate the effect of frequent ﬁres on sexual expression, pollination and reproductive success of Vachellia caven (Leguminosae), an andromonoecious tree that is highly dependent on animal pollination and is abundant in burned sites. We expect that increased ﬁre frequency will favour maleness but it will decrease reproductive success due to abiotic resource depletion in repeated burned sites. To test this, we selected focal plants in three unburned sites and three frequently burned sites and measured their sexual expression, basal diameter, pollination and fruit set. The proportion of male inﬂorescences per plant was not affected by ﬁre and it was negatively related with the diameter of the plant. The proportion of pollinated ﬂowers was not affected by ﬁre, and fruit set increased with maleness only in frequently burned sites. These results indicate that V. caven is adapted to regimes of high ﬁre frequency: not only was there similar fruit set in both burned and unburned sites, but more male plants had higher fruit set in burned sites. Despite the soil impoverishment triggered by repeated ﬁres, V. caven is able to maintain its sexual and reproductive functions, allowing it to persist and maintain viable populations in ﬁre-prone environments.</p>

Researchers selected three unburned sites and three frequently burned sites (3–4 ﬁres in 25 years) with similar topography. They sampled 42 adult plants, measuring basal diameter, sexual expression (proportion of male inflorescences), pollination success (polyad deposition on stigma), and female reproductive success (fruit set).<br><br>Statistical analysis using Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) found that the frequency of ﬁre did not affect the proportion of male inﬂorescences per plant. Instead, maleness was negatively related to plant diameter, meaning smaller plants were more male-biased regardless of the ﬁre history. Furthermore, fire frequency had no significant effect on the proportion of pollinated flowers, suggesting that pollination services remained robust even in frequently burned areas.<br><br>Crucially, overall fruit set (female reproductive success) was similar between the frequently burned and unburned sites, contradicting the expectation that resource depletion from frequent fires would limit reproduction. An unexpected finding was that fruit set increased with maleness (proportion of male flowers) specifically in frequently burned sites.

This adaptation allows it to sustain sexual and reproductive functions even when soil resources are potentially impoverished by repeated burning. The similarity in fruit set between burned and unburned sites shows that *V. caven* avoids the trade-off expected under resource-limited conditions, where resource allocation typically shifts towards the less costly male function at the expense of female output.<br><br>While the study hypothesized that resource depletion would favor maleness, the observed lack of change in sexual expression suggests that the species successfully acquires or reallocates sufficient resources for reproduction post-ﬁre. The positive relationship between maleness and fruit set found specifically in burned sites is interpreted as a compensatory mechanism, potentially by reducing sexual interference or enhancing pollinator visits. Ultimately, the capacity of *V. caven* to maintain viable sexual reproduction, alongside its ability to resprout, is the key mechanism enabling it to persist and form stable, dominant populations in highly disturbed, fire-prone environments.</div>

Tradicionalmente se han descrito las características de nuestra vegetación por la negativa, «el Uruguay es un país sin árboles». En las descripciones de la flora sólo se resaltan los elementos arbóreos, incluso aquellos exóticos. Basta observar las imágenes asociadas al «Uruguay Natural» para darnos cuenta que los pastizales son un tipo de vegetación «invisible» desde el punto de vista estético o recreativo y con frecuencia también desde el punto de vista productivo. En el mundo es cada vez más común la alimentación del ganado a través del reemplazo de la vegetación natural o del uso de concentrados en «feedlots». Estos últimos son casos extremos de simplificación del sistema productivo y se enmarcan en una visión de intervención del tipo «comando-control» por parte de quienes manejan los recursos. La mayor parte de estas estrategias de intervención están asociadas a tecnologías apropiables y, consecuentemente de fácil comercialización en el mercado en forma de paquetes tecnológicos. Estas tecnologías empiezan a ser cuestionadas por su baja eficiencia energética, su dependencia de insumos y sus consecuencias ambientales y sociales. Una visión distinta del manejo de los sistemas productivos considera el aprovechamiento del potencial de los sistemas naturales en términos de su productividad como de su resiliencia. Manejar los pastizales naturales, plantea serios desafíos ya que implica tratar con sistemas más complejos, es decir más heterogéneos, con más componentes e interacciones. Las tecnologías para el manejo de sistemas complejos se apoyan mucho más en procesos que en insumos, lo cual las hace poco susceptibles de apropiación por parte del sector privado. Esto hace que el desarrollo de este tipo de tecnología sea una responsabilidad, fundamentalmente, del sector público. Uruguay reúne excelentes condiciones para destacarse como productor natural, por lo que el desarrollo de tecnologías que compatibilicen la producción con la conservación del campo natural debería ser una prioridad. Este objetivo es inalcanzable sin un sólido conocimiento de, por un lado, la heterogeneidad florística de los pastizales naturales y, por otro, de la estructura y el funcionamiento de estos ecosistemas.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The book synthesizes research from the FPTA 175 project focused on developing ecological and technological bases for adaptive management of the complex natural grasslands (Campo Natural, CN) of Uruguay, which constitutes over 70% of the territory and forms part of the Río de la Plata temperate prairies.<br><br>### Structural and Compositional Analysis<br>The research first established the ecological structure by analyzing floristic heterogeneity. Chapter I describes how 13 vegetation units were objectively defined across four major geomorphological regions (e.g., Cuesta basáltica, Sierras del este) using phytosociological analysis of 313 vegetation censuses. Chapter II details the methodology for cartographing these units using supervised classification of high-resolution satellite imagery (Landsat TM), providing a spatial pattern of heterogeneity.<br><br>### Impact of Grazing and Ecosystem Function<br>The text addresses the functional consequences of land use. Chapter IV summarizes the evidence regarding the effects of domestic livestock grazing on vegetation structure (changes in architecture, species composition, and individual species attributes). Chapters V and VI focus on the below-ground system, with Chapter V synthesizing data on the effects of grazing on the biogeochemical cycles of Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N), and Chapter VI analyzing the relationship between vegetation units and soil macrofauna composition, confirming the crucial role of biota in soil condition and vegetation characteristics.<br><br>### Technological Tools for Adaptive Management<br>A major component is the development of technology for monitoring Net Aerial Primary Productivity (PPNA), a key variable for pastoral systems. Chapters VII and VIII detail the theory and methodology for estimating PPNA using remote sensing, focusing on the calculation of Radiation Use Efficiency (EUR). Chapters IX and X describe the implementation of a pilot forage monitoring system for Uruguay. This system provides objective, monthly data on forage production per paddock, crucial for short-term decision-making (paddock rotation) and long-term evaluation of management impacts on forage productivity and animal production variables (weight, corporal state). This technological approach supports the shift away from input-dependent systems towards process-based, adaptive management.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The core conclusion presented in the introduction is that the long-standing management approach, often characterized by 'command-control' interventions, simplification, and replacement of natural vegetation, is unsustainable, inefficient, and detrimental environmentally and socially. Given Uruguay's excellent potential as a 'natural producer,' the development of technologies that successfully reconcile livestock production with the conservation of the complex natural grassland ecosystem is deemed a fundamental priority.<br><br>Achieving this compatibility necessitates a robust foundation of ecological knowledge concerning floristic heterogeneity, ecosystem structure, and ecosystem function. The research outlined in the book provides this foundation by characterizing ecological complexity (vegetation units, grazing impacts on C and N cycles, soil biota roles) and offering sophisticated technological instruments (remote sensing for PPNA) to enable objective, data-driven, adaptive management. The research is designed to shift management focus from easily commercializable input packages (appropriate for simplified systems) to process-based technologies, which are essential for managing complex natural systems and are primarily the responsibility of the public sector. This integrated approach ultimately aims to strengthen the national system of agricultural research and ensure sustainable development of the sector.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Background
South America hosts some of the world’s most prominent biodiversity hotspots. Yet,
Uruguay – a country where multiple major ecosystems converge – ranks amongst the
countries with the lowest levels of available digital biodiversity data in the continent. Such
prevalent data scarcity has significantly undermined our ability to progress towards
evidence-based conservation actions – a critical limitation for a country with a strong focus
on agricultural industries and only 1.3% of the land surface guarded by protected areas.
Under today’s rapid biodiversity loss and environmental changes, the need for open-
access biodiversity data is more pressing than ever before. To address this national issue,
Biodiversidata – Uruguay’s first Consortium of Biodiversity Data – has recently emerged
with the aim of assembling a constantly growing database for the biodiversity of this
country. While the first phase of the project targeted vertebrate biodiversity, the second
phase presented in this paper spans the biodiversity of plants.
New information
As part of the second phase of the Biodiversidata initiative, we present the first
comprehensive open-access species-level database of the vascular plant diversity
recorded in Uruguay to date (i.e. all species for which data are currently available and
species presence has been confirmed). It contains 12,470 occurrence records from across
1,648 species and 160 families, which roughly represents 60% of the total recorded flora of
Uruguay. The primary biodiversity data include extant native and introduced species from
the lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms groups. Records were collated from
multiple sources, including data available in peer-reviewed scientific literature, institutional
scientific collections and datasets contributed by members of the Biodiversidata initiative.
The complete database can be accessed at the Zenodo repository: doi.org/10.5281/

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The Biodiversidata initiative, Uruguay's first Consortium of Biodiversity Data, addresses the critical lack of digital biodiversity data in the country by focusing on vascular plants in its second phase, following an initial focus on vertebrates. The main outcome is the creation of the first comprehensive open-access species-level database for vascular plant diversity in Uruguay, encompassing 12,470 occurrence records from 1,648 species across 160 families. This substantial compilation represents approximately 60% of Uruguay’s known flora, covering lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, including both extant native and introduced species.<br><br>Data mobilization was exhaustive, drawing from multiple sources: peer-reviewed scientific literature, institutional scientific collections (e.g., MVM, MVJB), and primary records contributed by Biodiversidata members. Online data was primarily harvested from GBIF, filtered rigorously for the Tracheophyta taxon within Uruguay, collected after 1900, requiring geographic coordinates, and excluding records with spatial issues. After quality control, 3,428 GBIF records were retained, with significant contributions from institutions like the Missouri Botanical Garden and citizen science data via iNaturalist.<br><br>To ensure data fitness, the authors implemented rigorous quality control following the Darwin Core standard and FAIR principles. This included automated processing in R to check misspellings, resolve synonymy, and standardize taxonomic nomenclature against sources like World Flora Online and Darwinion. Georeferences were meticulously checked, filtering out records occurring outside Uruguay's continental territory. Furthermore, the ‘establishmentMeans’ term was used to classify species as native or introduced. The resulting database exhibits high integrity, with all 12,470 records containing coordinate information and 89.2% including a date of collection, providing the necessary spatial and temporal precision previously missing in national databases.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors strongly assert that Uruguay must immediately transition its biodiversity information management system toward widespread digitization and open-access sharing of databases. This need is framed as critical, given that Uruguay faces accelerating environmental changes, holds one of the lowest levels of digitally-available biodiversity data in Latin America, has the least developed protected area network in the region, and is experiencing high land modification rates (over 36.2% of the territory already altered).<br><br>This new vascular plant database fills a crucial gap left by previous standard approaches in Uruguay, which relied on broad grid-cell maps that led to serious data leakage and loss of spatial and temporal precision. By providing a standardized, comprehensive, open-access resource, Biodiversidata enables the progress of evidence-based conservation actions, which is essential for a country dominated by agricultural industries. Although the data may exhibit historical sampling biases, similar to those found in the prior phase focusing on tetrapods, the compilation of vascular plant data, combined with the vertebrate data, establishes an unprecedented resource vital for supporting biodiversity studies and effective management, particularly within the vulnerable Río de la Plata grasslands ecosystem.</div>

The process involved three key steps: 1) selecting Neotropical ecoregions and excluding Nearctic/Andean areas; 2) meticulously modifying boundaries using updated information from regional studies (e.g., incorporating specific shapefiles for Brazilian 'campos rupestres' and Colombian paramos, and modifying boundaries for Argentinean and Mexican/Central American provinces based on recent literature); 3) generating individual shapefiles for each province, including metadata on the subregion or transition zone, and finally converting the complete set into a raster format (30 arc-seconds resolution) to ensure compatibility with other environmental data sources.<br><br>### Results<br><br>The resulting regionalization recognizes 57 biogeographic provinces classified into three main subregions and two transition zones. The three subregions are: the Antillean subregion (7 provinces), the Brazilian subregion (27 provinces across four dominions), and the Chacoan subregion (11 provinces across three dominions). The two transition zones are the Mexican Transition Zone (5 provinces) and the South American Transition Zone (7 provinces, including high-altitude Andean areas and desert regions).

Most of these discussions deal with decidedly specialist themes and the editors have been particularly concerned to ensure that the authors enjoyed the greatest possible freedom in the preparation of their work in order that different points of view and interpretations, together with some questions of controversy, may be clarified. This also applies, of course, to the several chapters in which general themes (geographical substance, climate, geology, vegetation, amongst others) are discussed.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The text, serving as the introduction to the two-volume collection on South American Biogeography and Ecology, establishes the scope and methodology of the work. It notes that the 29 contributions serve as a ‘preparatory work’ for a complete continental description, allowing specialists freedom to discuss controversial topics and differing interpretations.<br><br>*   **Geographic Complexity and Historical Context:** The editors stress the immense and unmistakable richness and vertical differentiation of South America, which results in regional complexity and sharply contrasting ecosystems (e.g., Amazonian hylaea, altiplano). Historically, despite this diversity, a cohesive 'South American space-consciousness' was impaired because intellectual and political orientation remained focused on Europe (Madrid and Lisbon) for centuries, delaying inter-continental relations and a necessary understanding of the continent's natural unity.<br><br>*   **Methodology and Biohistorical Perspective:** The work integrates abiotic data (geology, climate) with specialist systematic studies. The distribution pattern of each taxon is identified as fundamental to its 'unquantizable character,' determined by genetic, ecological, and biohistorical destiny. This biohistorical perspective is critical for analyzing distribution patterns and understanding the continent's ecological structure, even if the data for many groups remain insufficient.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The introduction concludes by emphasizing that a realistic biogeographical picture of South America must acknowledge that the continent's fundamental biotic structure has been significantly transformed by humanity, referred to as the 'super-organic factor,' since pre-historic times. While man arrived late, his influence is now commanding and pervasive.<br><br>*   **Anthropogenic Degradation and Sensitivity:** The history of colonization, particularly by Western peoples unfamiliar with local conditions, led to severe difficulties in 'adjustment' for both man and the natural environment. This lack of adjustment manifests as large-scale, detrimental modifications to the natural scene. The text explicitly lists symptoms relevant to degradation, such as **disafforestation, erosion, soil degradation,** and 'catastrophies due to weeds and pests,' underscoring the extraordinary susceptibility (sensitivity) of South America’s natural realities to human interference.<br><br>*   **Call for Research and Conservation:** The editors assert that understanding these modifications and unresolved questions is essential. The volume aims to further an intensification of inter-continental relations and a necessary understanding of the continent's natural unity, thereby contributing to effective conservation and sustainable development, which requires moving beyond superficial observation of the degradation patterns.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) are deciduous and semideciduous seasonal forests that are geographically distant from each other in South America, but share multiple species in common. How did these disjunct species distributions arise and what changes in their distribution can be expected under climate change? Gymnanthes boticario, a SDTF specialist, is a perfect model to test these questions.Occurrence data were obtained from herbarium sheets and confirmed by the authors and/or taxonomic publications. We selected bioclimatic variables for past, current and future scenarios and modeled the potential distribution of Gymnanthes boticario for three paleoclimatic conditions and two future climate change scenarios. We found an unexpectedly large geographical extent of climate suitability for G. boticario during the Last Interglacial (LIG), forming a possible connection between the Brazilian dry Caatinga forests and the dry forests of Bolivia. In the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), our model shows a reduction in the extent of suitability compared to the LIG, making the suitable area more similar to that modelled for the current period. For all future climate change scenarios, we found a decrease in the total suitable area. The future scenario of SSP585 is most severe, with a loss of almost 60 % of G.boticario suitable areas. We show that during drier timeframes, dry forests likely became less geographically distant from each other, allowing migration between the two now isolated dry forests. This historic connectivity could explain the considerable number of species disjunctions between Caatinga and Bolivian dry forests. Our models indicate that the broadest distribution of SDTF may have occurred during the LIG, and not in the LGM as previously thought. Moreover, climate change models indicate that the future may be even more challenging than the current for SDTF habitats.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study utilized Ensemble Species Distribution Modeling (eSDM), incorporating three algorithms (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Maximum Entropy), to analyze the potential range shifts of the specialist plant *Gymnanthes boticario* across South American Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF). To manage collinearity among the 19 bioclimatic variables used for past, current, and future scenarios, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed, yielding six predictors that accounted for 96.15% of the data variation. The models spanned three paleoclimatic conditions (LIG, LGM, MH), the current period (1981–2010), and future projections (2055 and 2085) under optimistic (SSP126) and pessimistic (SSP585) routes.<br><br>Results addressing the Pleistocene Arc Hypothesis showed that the Last Interglacial (LIG, 130 Kya) exhibited the broadest geographical extent of climate suitability for *G. boticario*, forming a potential continuous corridor connecting the Caatinga and Bolivian dry forests. This finding suggests the broadest SDTF distribution occurred during the LIG, contradicting older theories focused on the LGM. Furthermore, for future scenarios, a consistent and worrying decrease in total suitable area was projected. The most severe reduction occurred under the pessimistic SSP585 climate change scenario, predicting a loss of nearly 60% of the suitable habitat for the specialist species. This indicates that while past drier climates fostered connectivity and range expansion, current climate change driven by aridity and desertification will severely challenge the persistence of specialized dry forest species.</div>

This challenges the long-standing belief that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) represented the maximal expansion period for SDTFs.<br><br>Crucially for conservation, the study highlights the extreme vulnerability of SDTF habitats to future climate change. The models forecast that increasing aridity, aligning with predictions for the expansion of semi-arid and arid areas and accelerated desertification, will result in significant habitat loss. The anticipated reduction in suitable areas (up to 60% loss under SSP585) demonstrates that even specialist species adapted to dry conditions, governed by niche conservatism, will not be able to tolerate the drastic environmental shifts projected. Therefore, the future outlook for SDTF habitats is projected to be significantly more challenging than current conditions.</div>

All arboreal individuals with Diameter at Breast Height (DAP/DBH) ≥ 10 cm were identified, measured, and permanently marked.<br><br>The horizontal structure was assessed using traditional phytosociological parameters (Absolute and Relative Density, Dominance, and Frequency, Cover Value, and Importance Value). Diversity was calculated using the Shannon index (H’). Vegetational dynamics were analyzed by calculating ingrowth (new trees reaching the minimum DAP), mortality, and Annual Periodic Increment (IPA) in diameter, standardized by the number of years monitored.<br><br>## Results<br><br>*   **Floristics and Diversity:** The area exhibited very low floristic diversity (Shannon H' of 0.72 in 2001 and 0.71 in 2009). The arboreal layer was comprised of only four species: *Prosopis affinis*, *Prosopis nigra*, *Acacia caven*, and *Scutia buxifolia*. The family Fabaceae dominated, representing 99.9% of sampled individuals.<br>*   **Structure and Dominance:** The density remained stable, increasing slightly from 141 individuals per hectare in 2001 to 145 individuals per hectare in 2009. Area basal also showed minimal change (4.20 m²/ha to 4.25 m²/ha). *Prosopis affinis* and *Prosopis nigra* were overwhelmingly dominant, collectively accounting for over 93% of the Importance Value (VI) in both survey years. The diameter distribution followed the expected inverted ‘J’ shape but showed no significant frequency shifts between the two sampling periods.<br>*   **Dynamics:** Population turnover was extremely slow. Both ingrowth (new individuals reaching 10 cm DAP) and mortality rates were calculated at a low 0.36% annually. Only four individuals ingressed (all *P. affinis*), and four died (two *P. affinis*, one *P. nigra*, and one *A. caven*).

The goal was to identify and map areas suffering from land degradation using national criteria developed for reporting to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification). The study also analyzed the current institutional and normative framework, and the socio-economic dynamics (e.g., HDI, poverty rates) influencing land use in the region.<br><br>### Results<br>1.  **Extensive Degradation:** The assessment confirms significant degradation of natural lands in the northern zone, largely attributed to anthropogenic factors. Figure 28 maps the distribution of potentially degraded lands based on national criteria.<br>2.  **Land Use Change:** There were notable changes in land cover between 2000 and 2015, with transitions classified as 'negative' according to criteria assessing soil use sustainability (Figure 26). The expansion of non-grassland uses (e.g., forestry, intensive agriculture) is a primary driver.<br>3.  **Soil Health:** High levels of anthropogenic erosion were observed in the pilot zone (Figure 31). The study also monitored the status of hydrological resources and soil organic carbon.<br>4.  **Biodiversity Threat:** Degradation leads to a loss of biodiversity, with specific communities of pastizales being threatened (Figure 34). The report also highlights issues with invasive species, such as *Capín Anoni* (Figure 38).<br>5.  **Socio-economic Context:** The study notes that the pilot region suffers from lower socio-economic indicators (e.g., higher poverty and NBI rates) compared to the national average, which exacerbates pressure on natural resources.</div>

Existing frameworks often fail to incentivize the conservation of natural field ecosystems effectively or address the complex, localized nature of degradation.<br><br>Ultimately, the report emphasizes the necessity of shifting towards integrated territorial management strategies. These strategies must recognize the ecological value of the natural grassland ecosystem (e.g., the Bioma Pampa-Quebradas del Norte) and promote ‘buenas prácticas’ (good practices) that ensure resilience. Recommendations call for strengthening regulatory bodies and creating economic mechanisms that directly reward producers for maintaining the health and productivity of the natural field, thereby reversing current degradation trends.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Savannas first began to spread across Africa during the Miocene. A major hypothesis for explaining this vegetation change is the increase in C4 grasses, promoting fire. We investigated whether mammals could also have contributed to savanna expansion by using spinescence as a marker of mammal herbivory. Looking at the present distribution of 1,852 tree species, we established that spinescence is mainly associated with two functional types of mammals: large browsers and medium-sized mixed feeders. Using a dated phylogeny for the same tree species, we found that spinescence evolved at least 55 times. The diversification of spiny plants occurred long after the evolution of Afrotherian proboscideans and hyracoids. However, it is remarkably congruent with diversification of bovids, the lineage including the antelope that predominantly browse these plants today. Our findings suggest that herbivore-adapted savannas evolved several million years before fire-maintained savannas and probably, in different environmental conditions. Spiny savannas with abundant mammal herbivores occur in drier climates and on nutrient-rich soils, whereas fire-maintained savannas occur in wetter climates on nutrient-poor soils.</p>

They analyzed the present distribution of spiny traits across 1,852 tree species in Africa, employing spatial models to link spinescence to herbivore functional types, abiotic factors, and vegetation types. Results showed that spiny communities were primarily associated with two functional types of mammals—large browsers and medium-sized mixed feeders—and occurred mainly in open environments (mixed savannas, shrublands), dry climates, and on nutrient-rich soils where fire frequency was low. The unique contribution of herbivores to spinescence distribution remained significant even after accounting for abiotic factors.<br><br>Phylogenetic analysis revealed that spinescence evolved independently at least 55 times across 29 families of African trees, indicating strong convergent evolution. The timing of this diversification was crucial: spiny clades radiated mostly within the last 17 million years (mid-Miocene). This timeline did not align with earlier African megaherbivores (proboscideans and hyracoids), but it was remarkably congruent with the diversification of bovids (antelope), the primary browsers of these plants today. This temporal match suggests a powerful coevolutionary link between the diversification of bovids and the evolution of structural defenses in woody plants.</div>

These two types of open ecosystems are ecologically distinct, existing under different environmental conditions: herbivore-maintained spiny savannas are found in drier climates with nutrient-rich soils, supporting high mammal biomass, whereas fire-maintained savannas occur in wetter, nutrient-poor areas. Therefore, the diversification of bovids and the subsequent convergent evolution of spiny defenses fundamentally changed the rules for woody plant persistence, establishing browser pressure as a major, overlooked driver in the origin and spread of open ecosystems from the late Miocene.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Nurse plant facilitation in stressful environments can produce an environment with relatively low stress under its canopy. These nurse plants may produce the conditions promoting intense competition between coexisting species under the canopy, and canopies may establish stress gradients, where stress increases toward the edge of the canopy. Competition and facilitation on these stress gradients may control species distributions in the communities under canopies. We tested the following predictions: (1) interactions between understory species shift from competition to facilitation in habitats experiencing increasing stress from the center to the edge of canopy of a nurse plant, and (2) species distributions in understory communities are controlled by competitive interactions at the center of canopy, and facilitation at the edge of the canopy. We tested these predictions using a neighbor removal experiment under nurse trees growing in arid environments. Established individuals of each of four of the most common herbaceous species in the understory were used in the experiment. Two species were more frequent in the center of the canopy, and two species were more frequent at the edge of the canopy. Established individuals of each species were subjected to neighbor removal or control treatments in both canopy center and edge habitats. We found a shift from competitive to facilitative interactions from the center to the edge of the canopy. The shift in the effect of neighbors on the target species can help to explain species distributions in these canopies. Canopy- dominant species only perform well in the presence of neighbors in the edge microhabitat. Competition from canopy- dominant species can also limit the performance of edge- dominant species in the canopy microhabitat. The shift from competition to facilitation under nurse plant canopies can structure the understory communities in extremely stressful environments.</p>

This environment is characterized by high daily temperatures, low soil moisture, and nutrient-impoverished soil, but the nurse tree creates heterogeneous microhabitats. Previous findings (referenced here) established that the under-canopy areas have high soil nutrients and water availability, lower soil temperatures (37°C vs. 47°C outside), and significantly reduced PAR, creating a stress gradient that increases from the center to the edge of the canopy.<br><br>To test the predictions of the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH) in this fine-scale gradient, the researchers conducted a neighbor removal experiment. Four common perennial herbaceous species with differing distribution patterns (two canopy specialists: *Salvia aegyptiaca* and *Fagonia indica*; and two edge specialists: *Farsetia aegyptia* and *Indigofera spinosa*) were selected as targets. Established individuals were subjected to either 'neighbors removed' (clearing a 50 cm plot) or 'neighbors left intact' treatments in both the canopy center (low stress) and the canopy edge (high stress) microhabitats, replicated ten times per species per location. Plant performance was measured using a growth index based on biomass accumulation.<br><br>The results strongly supported the predictions. The study documented a clear shift from competitive interactions (in the benign canopy center) to facilitative interactions (at the more stressful canopy edge). This shift explained the observed species distributions: canopy-dominant species required the presence of neighbors (facilitation) to perform well in the high-stress edge microhabitat. Conversely, competitive interactions originating from these canopy-dominant species limited the growth and performance of the edge-dominant species when they occurred in the canopy center microhabitat.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the shifting balance between competition and facilitation, controlled by microhabitat stress gradients, fundamentally structures understory communities in extremely stressful arid environments. The nurse plant (Acacia gerrardii) ameliorates the harsh external conditions, creating a relatively benign zone beneath its canopy where resource competition among beneficiary species becomes intense. However, moving outward toward the canopy edge, where abiotic stress increases significantly, facilitation becomes the dominant interaction, allowing species to persist by buffering environmental harshness.<br><br>This small-scale heterogeneity is critical for understanding species coexistence and distribution. The observed shift from negative (competition) to positive (facilitation) interactions strongly supports the Stress Gradient Hypothesis. The findings underscore that within the overall positive 'nurse syndrome,' localized competition is a powerful force limiting the performance of certain species in the most protected areas, while facilitation is essential for the persistence of key species in the marginal, high-stress zones of the canopy. This mechanism demonstrates how nurse plant microhabitats promote both coexistence and localized dominance.</div>

Essa tipologia abriga uma vegetação peculiar, não ocorrendo em outras áreas do país, com presença de espécies endêmicas e vulneráveis. Para a análise, foi instalada uma unidade amostral permanente de 4ha (200x200m) subdividida em 400 subunidades de 100m² (10x10m) cada. Dessas, foram sorteadas 60 subunidades, em que todos os indivíduos com altura superior a 30cm e diâmetro ao nível do solo (DNS) tomado a ±03cm de altura, inferior a 9,5cm foram amostrados. Foram encontrados 174 indivíduos, distribuídos em cinco famílias botânicas, seis gêneros e seis espécies. A regeneração natural apresentou Índice de Diversidade de Shannon estimado em 0,82, indicando resultados baixos para a diversidade de espécies. As espécies com maiores valores de importância foram Vachellia caven (Molina) Molina (63,96%) e Celtis ehrenbergiana (Klotzsch)
Liebm. (30%). Essas duas espécies apresentaram comportamento agregado, enquanto Prosopis affinis Spreng., espécie característica do parque, obteve comportamento não agregado segundo o Índice de Payandeh. A regeneração natural da área não se encontra balanceada, entretanto segue o modelo “J invertido”, apresentando déficit de indivíduos na classe inicial de diâmetro, possivelmente devido ao pastoreio atualmente realizado no local.</p>

The population structure's observed deficit in the initial diameter classes is linked to current grazing activity (*pastoreio*) in the area. The study also cites external literature noting that environmental impacts such as cattle creation and fire management, particularly in areas of *Prosopis* distribution, cause severe damage and lead to **invasion by thorny shrubs** of the genera *Vachellia*, *Celtis*, and *Mimosa*.<br><br>This invasion results in dense scrubland, ultimately hindering the natural regeneration of the typical arboreal species of the Savana Estépica Parque.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">In the Argentinean Pampas, where Phaeozems soils are predominant, the conversion of native grasslands into croplands has negatively affected soil fertility and health. Nitrogen (N) mineralized during an anaerobic incubation (Nan), an estimator of N potential mineralization, is frequently used to evaluate soil health. The objectives of our study were to determine the magnitude of the Nan depletion caused by agriculture (dNan), and to assess the relative contribution of land use, climate, and soil properties on dNan in the Argentinean Pampas. We conducted a soil survey at 409 sites distributed throughout the Argentinean Pampas region. At each site, pairwise samples (0–20 cm) were collected from uncultivated and agricultural soils. At each site, different edaphic, climatic, and productive variables were evaluated. The direct and indirect effect of different variables over dNan was evaluated through a path analysis. The conversion of native grasslands from the Argentinean Pampas into croplands generally decreased Nan values, with Nan reductions ranging from 0 to 216 mg kg−1 (representing 0 to 79 % of the Nan value at uncultivated soils). The magnitude of the Nan depletion was influenced by edaphic variables [i.e. original Nan value (Nan at uncropped soils), soil organic matter depletion, clay content] and climatic variables (i.e. precipitation). These four variables explained 85 % of the dNan variability. From the path analysis, it was determined that soils with greater original Nan values (r = 0.89) and greater soil organic matter depletion (r = 0.65) presented larger dNan, while increases in clay content (r = 0.30) or mean annual precipitation (r = 0.25) resulted in lower dNan values. The identification of the drivers of Nan depletion can aid in the classification of areas with greater vulnerability to soil degradation and in the development of models to predict Nan depletion in soils. Such models would hold significant potential as tools for policymakers and program developers engaged in the formulation and implementation of targeted interventions aimed at halting or reversing this degradation process.</p>

Given that Neotropical and Afrotropical regions have contrasting histories of the megafauna (because of the Holocene megafaunal extinction in the Neotropics), we hypothesize that they should harbour plants with different traits in relationship to herbivory and fire, especially in savannas. We predicted that herbivory resistance traits should be more prominent in Afrotropical savanna plants and fire resistance in Neotropical savanna plants. Location: Tropics. Time period: Not applicable. Major taxa studied: Angiosperms (woody). Methods: We compiled data for five key plant functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum tree height, spinescence and proportion of geoxyles) for forest and savanna woody species from the two distant regions (Afrotropics and Neotropics). We related these data to climate, soil and fire variables and tested predictions for megafauna selection. Results: Spines and high wood density were more common among Afrotropical than Neotropical savanna species and species from the two forests. Moreover, the Neotropical savanna region contained more geoxyles than the Afrotropical savanna region. Finally, Afrotropical species were taller than Neotropical species. These differences were consistent with our predictions for trait selection by the megafauna, and these patterns did not change when considering climate, soil and fire regimens in the models. Main conclusions: Our results highlight the great potential of these traits for summarizing disturbance strategy axes in tropical woody species and suggest that global variation in plant traits is unlikely to be understood fully without consideration of historical factors, especially the direct and indirect impacts of megafauna.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The researchers aimed to determine if the contrasting histories of megafauna in the Neotropics (post-Holocene extinction) and Afrotropics (retaining megafauna) resulted in differing plant functional traits related to herbivory and fire resistance in savannas. The study compiled data for five key traits: wood density (WD), specific leaf area (SLA), maximum tree height (HMax), spinescence (presence/absence), and the proportion of geoxyles across woody species in forest and savanna biomes in both regions. These comparisons utilized linear mixed-effect models, also factoring in climate, soil, and fire variables to isolate the impact of historical megafauna selection.<br><br>The results largely confirmed the megafauna selection hypothesis. Spines and high wood density, traits associated with mechanical resistance against large browsers, were significantly more prevalent among Afrotropical savanna species compared to Neotropical savanna species. Conversely, the Neotropical savanna region exhibited a higher proportion of geoxyles (underground trees)—a trait essential for fire survival—than the Afrotropical region. Furthermore, Afrotropical species were generally taller than Neotropical species. Crucially, these biogeographical differences, aligning with predictions of differential megafauna pressure, were found to be statistically robust and persisted even when environmental variables like climate, soil, and contemporary fire regimes were included in the statistical models.</div>

The primary finding is that global variation in plant functional traits cannot be adequately understood without incorporating historical factors, particularly the direct and indirect impacts stemming from megafauna.<br><br>Specifically, the trait divergence observed between the Afrotropical and Neotropical savannas reflects different historical selection pressures. The sustained presence of megaherbivores in Africa selected for strong herbivory defense traits (spines, high WD), while the loss of megafauna in the Neotropics likely led to a decrease in grazing pressure, favoring the shift toward fire-maintained ecosystems and the dominance of fire-resistance strategies, such as geoxyly. This emphasizes that while current ecological drivers are important, deep historical processes fundamentally modulate the adaptive strategies and biogeographical divergence of plant communities.</div>

El objetivo del trabajo fue evaluar la respuesta del pastizal natural de un bosque nativo degradado del Espinal argentino con arbustivas por medio de un control químico aéreo en un sistema ganadero con pastoreo rotativo de baja carga instantánea. El estudio se realizó en el Área Natural Protegida Reserva de Usos Múltiples Estancia "El Carayá" ubicada en el centro-norte de Entre Ríos, Argentina. Se realizaron 16 evaluaciones desde el año 2012 al 2015 sobre el sector tratado químicamente con Picloram+2,4-D y tres sectores sin tratamiento. En cada evaluación se cuantificó la cobertura vegetal, la composición florística de las especies forrajeras más representativas y la biomasa vegetal, comparadas mediante pruebas no paramétricas. Los resultados de este trabajo comprueban que la utilización de una técnica de control químico aéreo aumentó significativamente, un 44%, la cobertura y biomasa en las áreas tratadas de las especies forrajeras respecto al testigo. El control químico sobre las arbustivas persistió en el tiempo con una efectividad considerable durante los años de evaluación.

On April 20, 2012, an 85 ha sector was treated with an aerial application of Picloram + 2,4-D (4 L ha-1 commercial product), known to be a systemic herbicide targeting broadleaf weeds while sparing gramineous species and mature trees.

The results demonstrated that the use of aerial chemical control significantly increased the coverage and biomass of desirable forage species by 44% compared to the control areas. Furthermore, the chemical control over the shrubs persisted effectively during the years of evaluation.

Apesar da importância desses serviços, é rápida a conversão de áreas naturais nessa região do Brasil. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a florística e o estoque de C do solo e da serapilheira em áreas de campo e mata ciliar com distintos níveis de conservação no Pampa. As áreas de estudo foram denominadas como voçoroca (V), campo degradado (CD), campo conservado (CC), mata degradada (MD) e mata conservada (MC). V é uma área em processo avançado de erosão, composta por duas voçorocas. CD é uma área de campo nativo com carga animal de 310 kg de peso vivo por hectare e invasão biológica por Eragrostis plana Nees. CC também é uma área de campo nativo, porém manejada com carga animal de 170 kg de peso vivo por hectare. MD e MC são áreas de mata ciliar contíguas, sendo MD manejada com gado e MC isolada do gado. No levantamento florístico foram avaliadas a abundância e riqueza de espécies em parcelas de 1 m x 1 m (V, CD e CC), 10 m x 20 m (estrato arbóreo de MD e MC) e 10 m x 10 m (regeneração natural de MD e MC). Em cada área de estudo foram coletadas 20 amostras de serapilheira e cinco amostras de solo compostas nas profundidades de 0-5, 5-15, 15-30 e 30-100 cm. Foram determinados os teores de C e nitrogênio (N) e razão isotópica natural e calculados os Índices de Diversidade de Shannon (H’) e Equabilidade de Pielou (J’). Os dados de solo e serapilheira foram submetidos à ANOVA e teste de Tukey (p<0,05). Os dados de abundância, riqueza, diversidade e equabilidade das áreas de campo (V, CD e CC) foram submetidos ao teste de Kruskall-Wallis (p<0,05), seguido pelo teste de Dunn. Para comparar as médias de abundância, riqueza, diversidade e equabilidade do estrato arbóreo e regeneração natural das áreas de mata ciliar (MD e MC) foi realizada a ANOVA (teste F, p<0,05). No levantamento florístico foram amostrados 5.798 indivíduos, distribuídos em 38 famílias e 134 espécies. A abundância de indivíduos de V e CC foi diferente, mas não houve diferenças entre V, CD e CC para riqueza, H’ e J’. Nas matas ciliares, o uso pelo gado reduziu a abundância no estrato arbóreo e diminuiu drasticamente a abundância, riqueza e H’ na regeneração natural. A serapilheira se mostrou como um importante compartimento que armazena C nas áreas de campo e mata ciliar e seu acúmulo foi impactado pela degradação. A degradação modificou a composição de espécies e o estoque de C da serapilheira nas áreas de campo. O maior grau de degradação do solo em V diminuiu o estoque de C em relação a CD. O uso pelo gado impactou a estrutura e composição florística das áreas de mata ciliar, mas não alterou o estoque de C do solo. Os resultados deste estudo reforçam a importância do bioma Pampa na manutenção da biodiversidade vegetal e armazenamento de C no solo e serapilheira e podem apoiar a implementação de políticas públicas de conservação e restauração.</p>

It underpins the stability of ecosystems, provides vast bioresources for economic use, and has important cultural significance for many people. The Pampa biome, located in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, illustrates the direct and indirect interdependence of humans and biodiversity. The Brazilian Pampa lies within the South Temperate Zone where grasslands scattered with shrubs and trees are the dominant vegetation. The soil, originating from sedimentary rocks, often has an extremely sandy texture that makes them fragile—highly prone to water and wind erosion. Human activities have converted or degraded many areas of this biome. In this review we discuss our state-of-the-art knowledge of the diversity and the major biological features of this regions and the cultural factors that have shaped it. Our aim is to contribute toward a better understanding of the current status of this special biome and to describe how the interaction between human activities and the environment affects the region, highlighting the fragility of the Brazilian Pampa.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This review analyzes the diversity and intense degradation challenges facing the Brazilian Pampa, the second smallest Brazilian biome, located primarily in Rio Grande do Sul. The authors emphasize that the biome's fragility stems from its geology and soil properties. The region comprises four geological provinces, and soils derived from sedimentary rocks often possess an extremely sandy texture (especially Psamment soils/Neossolos Quartzarenicos in the Central Depression and parts of the Serra Geral Formation).<br><br>This inherent soil fragility, which makes them highly sensitive to water and wind erosion, is severely exacerbated by inappropriate human activities. Livestock production is historically a main economic activity based on natural grasslands, but alongside agriculture, overgrazing has contributed to intense soil degradation. A specific and devastating process, termed 'sandification,' occurs where sandy soils lose clay, silt, and organic matter, leading to nutrient depletion and loss of soil cohesion. These degraded areas, characterized by extensive sand patches, are difficult to reverse and expand through intense eolic erosion, creating a positive feedback cycle.<br><br>Regarding conservation, the authors discuss restoration strategies for sandification sites. Revegetation is considered the most successful recovery method, but plant establishment is difficult. While fast-growing exotic species (e.g., *Eucalyptus sp*, *Pinus sp*) have been proposed for their resistance, the review notes this approach is controversial, with counterarguments favoring the use of native plants.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The review concludes that the critical issue facing the Brazilian Pampa is its inherent fragility, primarily defined by geological composition that yields easily erodible, often sandy, soils. This natural susceptibility is greatly magnified by intensive and inappropriate human land-use practices, such as agriculture and overgrazing.<br><br>The resulting intense soil degradation, including severe erosion and sandification, is not only an ecological crisis but also contributes significantly to socio-economic fragility, as evidenced by low Social Development Indices in the affected region. The authors stress that effective conservation requires deep knowledge of the soil characteristics, potential, and limitations, especially since vast areas dominated by fragile soil types (Udults, Psamments, Orthents) place strong limitations on intensive agrosilvopastoral systems.<br><br>Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of this unique biome's current status and to highlight the urgent need for appropriate conservation management practices to ensure environmental and socioeconomic sustainability, contrasting the Pampa's decline with the status of other major Brazilian biomes.</div>

A adoção de práticas agrícolas no manejo da pastagem possibilita maior produtividade, evitando degradação, que está geralmente associada a menor quantidade ou mesmo à ausência da forrageira e à presença de grande quantidade de plantas daninhas. Em áreas com degração avançada, o programa de manejo das plantas daninhas deve ser utilizado em conjunto com práticas agrícolas de recuperação ou reforma da pastagem. O controle químico das plantas daninhas em pastagem vem sendo utilizado largamente nos sistemas de produção animal convencional. Alta eficiência no uso dos herbicidas ocorre quando há identificação da planta daninha e escolha do herbicida adequado. O uso e manejo de herbicidas em pastagem deve priorizar entendimento amplo da implantação e do manejo da pastagem, correlacionando-o com o possível aparecimento das plantas daninhas. Vale ressaltar que o método mais eficaz e barato é a prevenção. Logo, o bom manejo de estabelecimento e uso das pastagens pode ser um grande aliado no controle de plantas daninhas e a ele ser associado o controle químico adequado. Assim, o sucesso no programa de manejo das plantas daninhas com herbicidas demandará adequada seleção dentre as formulações disponíveis no mercado, seu manuseio correto e avaliação na eficiência do programa de manejo adotado. Este documento tem o objetivo de demonstrar que um programa de manejo de invasoras é prática importante, porém não se apresenta como solução única para garantir aumento na produtividade da pastagem.</p>

Weed infestation, particularly by broadleaf plants, is attributed to inadequate implementation practices (poor soil preparation, insufficient fertilization) and improper usage (sub- or super-grazing, burning).<br><br>The document outlines five main control methods: cultural (using aggressive forage cultivars), physical (fire), manual, mechanical (mowing), and chemical (herbicides). It strongly advocates for an integrated approach where chemical control is associated with global management improvements (correction, fertilization, load adjustment).<br><br>Key steps for effective chemical control include: 1) Verifying the remaining density of desirable forage species (if the area is too degraded, recovery or renovation is recommended); 2) Identifying the weed species to determine susceptibility; 3) Considering the foliage type, as tough leaves require specific additives or application methods (like stump application); and 4) Applying systemic herbicides during full vegetative development (rainy season), as efficacy drops significantly during flowering/fruiting when translocation to roots is reduced.<br><br>The text identifies woody species (shrubs and subshrubs) as the 'principal problem' in pastures, listing examples such as *Mata-pasto*, *Assa-peixe*, and various thorny species (*Unha-de-gato*). It emphasizes that good grazing management, specifically managing pasture height based on light interception (90% to 95%), acts as a preventive strategy by ensuring forage plant persistence and competitiveness, thereby minimizing the need for reactive weed control.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">The successional pathways linking the Acacia caven-dominated savanna habitat “espinal” and the closed sclerophyllous forest of central Chile have long been debated. Previously, espinal was considered an invasive degradation of closed forest that tended toward desertiﬁcation, could not be restored to forest, and had little ecological value. Recent GIS (Geographical Information System) research on land-use change has, however, detected apparent regeneration of sclerophyllous forest from espinal. This suggests that there is a successional path linking espinal and sclerophyllous forest. Here, we used surveys of transects in espinals and espinal–sclerophyllous forest transitions to ask whether (1) A. caven is an invasive spe-cies or a pioneer species, (2) forest regenerates by sclerophyllous trees “ﬁlling in” spaces between A. caven individuals, and then shading them out (plant–plant competition), or (3) forest regenerates by plant–plant facilitation between A. caven and other species, and (4) how current and historical management and condi-tion affect these potential successional mechanisms. We ﬁnd that A. caven establishes primarily in full sun-light and is unlikely to degrade forests via invasion. We also ﬁnd, for the ﬁrst time, evidence that A. caven is a nurse tree to several sclerophyllous forest tree-beneﬁciary species. Measurements of the under-canopy microhabitat of A. caven, compared to Lithraea caustica, another possible nurse species, suggest that it pro-vides a balance between shade and soil moisture retention, making it a regeneration site not only for direc-ted bird-dispersed seeds but also for undirected wind-dispersed ones. Conservation and restoration of espinals, especially in drier areas, could provide capacity for future dynamic successional pathways in cen-tral Chile.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study utilized field surveys across 27 transects in seven sites in central Chile, specifically sampling *Acacia caven*-dominated espinals and transitional zones leading to sclerophyllous forests. For 859 trees over 40 cm tall, researchers recorded species, size metrics (height, base diameter, canopy radius), location, and critically, instances of one tree establishing under the canopy of another to detect facilitation mechanisms. They also characterized the under-canopy microhabitat of *A. caven* (and *Lithraea caustica*) by measuring light and soil characteristics, and gathered historical land-use data from managers and owners.<br><br>The results decisively address the prevailing narrative, finding that *A. caven* establishment is consistent with a pioneer species, primarily establishing in full sunlight, and thus is "unlikely to degrade forests via invasion." The most significant finding is the documented evidence that *A. caven* functions as a nurse tree, facilitating the establishment of several sclerophyllous forest tree species. Microhabitat data supported this facilitative role: the under-canopy environment of *A. caven* provides a beneficial microclimate, offering a critical "balance between shade and soil moisture retention." This improved microsite condition aids the establishment of both bird-dispersed and wind-dispersed seeds, supporting the successional pathway through facilitation rather than competition.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study successfully reframed the ecological role of the *Acacia caven*-dominated espinal. It rejected the long-held viewpoint that espinal represents an irreversible, degraded ecological state resulting from anthropogenic disturbance.<br><br>Instead, the authors conclude that espinal functions as a pioneer successional stage following degradation or disturbance. The demonstrated role of *A. caven* as a nurse tree—improving microhabitat conditions like shade and soil moisture—proves a clear successional mechanism (plant–plant facilitation) linking the open espinal savanna to the closed sclerophyllous forest. This finding contradicts the competition hypothesis (where sclerophyllous trees merely shade out *A. caven*).<br><br>In terms of practical application, the authors conclude that conservation and restoration efforts must recognize and utilize the successional capacity of *A. caven*. They propose that actively conserving espinals, especially in arid areas, is vital because these formations provide the necessary capacity and foundation for future dynamic successional pathways and ecosystem recovery in central Chile.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study analyzes the unique 276-hectare Espinilho State Park in Uruguaiana, RS, Brazil, which exhibits a park-type vegetation distinct from the surrounding Campanha (Pampas) grasslands. This unique structure is defined primarily by the association of arboreal legumes: *Prosopis* species (algarrobo and inhanduvá) and *Acacia caven* (espinilho).<br><br>Investigation into the ecosystem's origin suggests that the flora is a relict population, originating from invasions of arboreal legumes from the Argentine Mesopotamian Park during a past, drier phase of the Quaternary period, reinforcing its paleoclimatic heritage.<br><br>The persistence of this xerophilous vegetation in a predominantly humid climatic region (RS) is explained by local natural conditions. The species exhibit significant adaptations—small, deciduous leaves, spines, thick bark, and deep, horizontally extensive root systems—designed to minimize water loss and cope with high thermal and pluviometric variability, coupled with specific, problematic edaphic conditions (shallow, poorly drained soils with expansive clays that hinder water storage).<br><br>Ecologically, the park provides crucial habitat for avifauna; several bird species, including *Anumbius annumbi*, *Coryphistera alaudina*, and *Picoides mixtus*, limit their known occurrence and nesting areas within Brazilian territory exclusively to the Espinilho Park.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The author concludes that the legal creation of the park (Decree 23.798/75) has failed to ensure its survival due to a lack of effective implementation measures, resources, and institutional will. The park lands remain under private ownership and are actively exploited. Exploitation includes the construction of dikes for irrigation, leading to gradual deforestation of the arboreal legumes and advancement of rice cultivation (*rizicultura*) and cattle grazing (*pecuária*) into the preserve.<br><br>Crucially, the greatest current threats are posed not just by local landowners but by governmental infrastructure projects, specifically proposed dams along the Uruguay River. The author stresses that governmental bodies (Municipal, State, or Federal) have a responsibility to the national natural heritage. Any spatial modification, particularly those affecting established Permanent Preservation Areas, must undergo prior technical assessment and public consultation to address the inevitable ecological and socioeconomic consequences. These impacts include the destruction of ancient ecological niches, the forcing of rural populations into displacement (exodus), and widespread political and economic destabilization.<br><br>The paper ultimately argues that the existence of protected areas often serves primarily as a mechanism for channeling financial resources to public administration organs, whose commitment to conservation is questionable given the progressive and unpunished degradation of these permanent preservation areas throughout Rio Grande do Sul.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Woody plant encroachment in grasslands represents one of the greatest challenges for global biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, this is a social-ecological problem, where human activity and behavior have resulted in significant changes in ecological processes that control woody plants, and failure to fully recognize the role of human activity has led to continued loss of grasslands worldwide. It is therefore critical that conservation professionals understand how ecological systems, settlement patterns, and fragmentation from anthropogenic development interact to influence rates of woody plant encroachment. Using annual estimates of tree cover derived from regionally available remote-sensing data, our objectives were, first, to describe rates of woody plant encroachment over the last 20 years (2000–2019) across three ecologically and socially diverse ecoregions in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Then, we examined how anthropogenic and biophysical variables influenced rates of encroachment (both directly and indirectly) within the region. Results indicate that, despite marked differences in social and ecological characteristics, all three ecoregions have experienced consistent increases in woody plant encroachment during the study period. This included the Flint Hills ecoregion of Kansas and Oklahoma, an area that experiences widespread and frequent fires. At the regional scale, rates of encroachment were directly and negatively related to the average area burned in a county, initial cover of trees, and fragmentation from row crops. Percent cover of development and row crop agriculture also indirectly alter rates of encroachment in a county by influencing initial tree cover and fire activity. The pervasive nature of woody plant encroachment, even in regions that experience frequent fires, suggests that many grasslands are being managed outside of critical ecological thresholds needed to maintain grasslands and limit woody encroachment, which can have significant implications for biodiversity. Our results show that anthropogenic or ecological factors do not act in isolation in their influence on woody plant encroachment and can form complex relationships that shape regional trends in woody plant encroachment.</p>

Our core vision focuses on reintroducing guanacos (Lama guanicoe) to central Chile in order to provide natural restoration and ecosystem processes in espinal woodlands dominated by the native tree Vachellia [Acacia] caven. We envision a scenario of “social-ecological rewilding” with widespread guanaco browsing in woodlands and guanaco migration across the region, coexisting with multiple human uses of the landscape. Guanacos would ideally be managed by regional collectives who could beneﬁt from guanaco tourism, sustainable harvest of their ﬁber (wool), and regulated hunting. Our wider vision for reintroductions and integrated conservation management extends to a set of other species that may have coexisted with guanacos and V. caven at various points in the past, but more research is necessary to establish and gain support for evidence-based baselines. Our strategy is to inspire actors with greater resources (land, money, inﬂuence) to share our vision and implement it, in collaboration with the NGO that we have formed to support our projects. Over ten years, circulating alternate interpretations and a novel imaginary of how central Chile was in the past and could be in the future, along with developing and testing scientiﬁc hypotheses, has moved our vision from an idea shared by two people to one that a wide variety of actors publicly embrace.</p>

The project began in 2014 and evolved through experimental work and social alliance building.<br><br>The first phase (2014–2016) was a naturalistic experiment confirming that guanacos spontaneously browse *V. caven*, which responds with compensatory growth—a finding that supports the initial hypothesis that this tree's growth pattern is an adaptation to browsing. This scientific finding is crucial as it leverages previous work showing that coppicing and pruning of the espino results in positive ecological outcomes, such as increased tree canopy and agricultural productivity. Subsequent phases involved the practical and regulatory challenges of releasing the experimental animals into a private nature sanctuary (Phase 2, 2017) and establishing a breeding and rehabilitation center (Phase 3, 2019–present).<br><br>Social strategy and results are central to the paper. The authors actively built consensus by organizing scientific symposiums and collaborating with various stakeholders, including conservation NGOs (like WCS Chile), academic researchers, private landowners, and public officials. This effort culminated in a broader vision (Phase 4, envisioned) to create a large corridor for guanaco migration and active release east of Santiago, combining conservation goals with local economic benefits (e.g., guanaco tourism and fiber harvest). The overall approach, described as circulating "alternate interpretations and a novel imaginary" of the region's past, has successfully transformed the project from an idea shared by two individuals into a widely supported regional initiative.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that successful ecological restoration, particularly rewilding, must adopt a social-ecological framework that actively seeks coexistence between nature restoration and sustainable human use. They argue that rewilding, which aims to restore keystone processes through species reintroduction (like guanaco browsing), is compatible with human interactions and resource use, challenging the common conservation belief that environmental management must be 'anti-cattle and anti-resource use.'<br><br>They highlight a significant gap in Chilean conservation, noting that many private landholders and environmentalists assume traditional practices like non-intensive cattle grazing and timber resource use are negative, often lacking local empirical evidence. Conversely, the authors hypothesize that the historical removal of native large browsers, followed by the contemporary regulatory reduction of traditional cattle/horse grazing and activities like leaf raking, may actually *contribute* to negative environmental outcomes, such as increasing the intensity of wildfires. Therefore, the rewilding strategy is inherently social: it aims to integrate the restored ecological processes (guanaco presence) into regional collectives that derive tangible economic and cultural benefits, ensuring the project's long-term viability and social acceptance by aligning conservation with diversified rural livelihoods.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">The evolutionary arms race between plants and herbivores has led to numerous plant adaptations, including spinescence. However, whether spinescence evolved primarily in response to herbivory, or whether abiotic conditions also played a role, remains unknown. We integrated phylogenetic, geographic, and trait data for 2,686 species of an ecologically diverse and spiny pantropical lineage – mimosoid legumes – with data for 235 extant and 185 extinct mammalian herbivores >10 kg. Using structural equation models, we assessed how herbivores, climate and fire directly and indirectly affected the proportion of spinescent mimosoids across global and continental assemblages. The proportion of spinescent mimosoids in assemblages increased with extant and extinct herbivore richness, drought and heat, while fire influenced spinescence indirectly, by affecting herbivore richness. Notably, correlations of spinescence differed between Africa and America, with increasing importance of extinct herbivores in Africa, illustrating legacy effects on spinescence. Megaherbivores have shaped spinescence in mimosoids, especially in dry environments, where losing plant tissues is costly. Spinescence originated ~35 Mya, with the transition of mimosoids to seasonally dry environments, pre-dating the Miocene expansion of savannas. Our study suggests that both long-term climatic transitions and the emergence of open, herbivore-rich landscapes played crucial roles in the evolution and distribution of spinescence.</p>

Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were utilized to assess the complex direct and indirect relationships between these variables across global and continental assemblages (specifically comparing Africa and America).<br><br>The main results demonstrated that the proportion of spinescent mimosoids in a given assemblage increased significantly with both extant and extinct megaherbivore richness. Spinescence also positively correlated directly with abiotic conditions, specifically drought and heat, highlighting that defense is particularly advantageous in environments where tissue loss is costly. Fire, however, did not show a direct influence on spinescence but acted indirectly by affecting herbivore richness. A crucial finding was the evidence for continental differences, suggesting that legacy effects are vital, particularly noting the severe megafauna extinctions experienced by the Americas during the Pleistocene.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that megaherbivores have fundamentally shaped the evolution and distribution of plant spinescence in mimosoids, particularly in seasonally dry environments. The study provides strong evidence that spinescence is the result of a complex interplay between megaherbivory, climate, and fire history, contradicting explanations focusing solely on contemporary pressures.<br><br>The research indicates that spinescence is an evolutionarily deep trait, originating approximately 35 million years ago, coinciding with the transition of mimosoids into seasonally dry environments, a period preceding the major expansion of global savannas. This deep history, combined with continental comparisons, suggests that spinescence can be considered an 'evolutionary anachronism' in areas that suffered severe megafauna extinction, such as parts of the Americas. Specifically, the legacy effects of extinct megaherbivores are necessary to fully explain the current distribution of spiny plants in regions now relatively poor in large herbivores. Thus, the final conclusion is that the distribution of these defense traits is shaped by a combination of long-term climatic transitions and the historical presence of open, herbivore-rich landscapes.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">The Pampa is the least protected and one of the least sampled for bats among the Brazilian domains. This leads to signiﬁcant Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls for bats in the Brazilian-Uruguayan savanna ecoregion. Here, we aimed to model the occupancy of aerial insectivorous bats in response to landscape structure at different scales, considering the inﬂuence of microclimate on bat detection. We acoustically monitored 68 locations during the spring and summer of 2019/2020, gathering data on temperature and humidity associated with each acoustic record using data loggers. We detected at least 11 species of the Molossidae and the Vespertilionidae families, of which 9 were used in the model. The response to landscape structure was species-speciﬁc: the occupancy probability of Eptesicus brasiliensis and Molossus cf. currentium increased with landscape connectivity at the 500 m scale while Eptesicus furinalis and Histiotus cf. velatus were negatively affected by landscape connectivity at the 5.0 km scale. Molossus occupancy probability responded negatively to landscape heterogeneity at the 3.0 km scale, while Promops centralis responded positively to landscape heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale. Molossus rufus responded negatively to native vegetation cover and positively to landscape heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale. Myotis albescens and Molossops temminckii did not respond signiﬁcantly to any of the evaluated landscape metrics. Our results show that different bat species perceive the landscape differently, regardless of the guild of use of space – edge- or open-space forager. Our estimate of projected occupancy for the areas contiguous to those sampled ranged from 0.45 to 0.70 for the whole of the bat taxa, suggesting that the landscape, particularly where it still maintains its native elements, is reasonably favourable to aerial insectivores.</p>

The sites spanned areas of pristine habitat (native grasslands, gallery forests, shrub formations) and those heavily influenced by cattle raising and agriculture (rice and soybean crops). Bat activity was quantified using "bat passes" (sequences of at least three consecutive, good quality echolocation calls). Landscape metrics were extracted from land use rasters using seven circular buffers ranging from 500 m to 5.0 km radius around each monitoring site.<br><br>The researchers detected at least 11 species from the Molossidae and Vespertilionidae families. Results showed that the response to landscape structure was highly species-specific and scale-dependent. For instance, the occupancy of *Eptesicus brasiliensis* increased with landscape connectivity at the small 500 m scale, while *Eptesicus furinalis* was negatively affected by connectivity at the larger 5.0 km scale. Landscape heterogeneity also had varied effects, positively affecting *Promops centralis* at 5.0 km but negatively affecting Molossus species at 3.0 km. Critically, *Molossus rufus* exhibited a negative response to native vegetation cover, despite responding positively to landscape heterogeneity. Overall, the projected occupancy for the bat taxa (0.45 to 0.70) suggested the landscape, particularly where native elements persist, is still reasonably favorable.</div>

This habitat loss and fragmentation significantly alter landscape structure and limit species persistence.<br><br>The core conclusion regarding bat ecology is that different species of aerial insectivores perceive and respond to changes in landscape structure in a species-specific and scale-dependent manner, regardless of their established foraging guild (edge- or open-space forager). This complexity underscores the limitation of simple guild classifications for conservation planning and necessitates fine-grained, species-specific analyses to understand biodiversity responses to human impact.<br><br>Despite the extensive degradation and habitat homogenization, the findings suggest that the remaining native elements of the Pampa landscape continue to support aerial insectivores effectively. The study strongly supports the conservation need for the Brazilian Pampa, emphasizing that maintaining and enhancing the existing landscape structure—such as connectivity and heterogeneity—is crucial for sustaining bat populations, which serve an important role as bioindicators and biological control agents.</div>

We believe that comparative socio-ecological research on woodland habitat trajectories among contexts is an excellent opportunity to consider possible rewilding approaches. Here, we draw on a comparison between arid and seasonally dry woodlands of the Sahel region of Africa and the Southern Cone of South America. The two regions, while sharing a common Gondwanan floral origin, differ in terms of subsequent biogeographical processes and have different climatic gradients. Historically, both regions were colonised, although along different models, and the Southern Cone has experienced greater land-use change and agricultural modernisation. Culturally, both regions have indigenous populations with traditional management techniques and local ecological knowledge, although attention to these topics in research and conservation has had different emphases in each region. Rewilding, focusing on charismatic animals, has been proposed and implemented in some parts of the Southern Cone, but has hardly been mentioned for the Sahel. We discuss the applicability of potential rewilding models involving key plants for each region, and what a plant-focused rewilding practice could gain from a comparative approach in the two regions.</p>

This approach is distinct because its goal is not species composition or conservation status, but the recovery of ecological functions, explicitly addressing the efficiency of intervening directly on plants. They justify this by noting that in drylands with variable rainfall, bottom-up ecological processes are often dominant, making direct plant intervention appropriate, contrary to the typical trophic rewilding focus on top-down animal impacts.<br><br>In their comparative analysis, the authors highlight that the Southern Cone has experienced significantly greater land-use change and agricultural modernization, focusing on industrial production (soy, cattle ranching, eucalyptus/pine plantations). This history has led to restoration practices that are often industrial compensations, typically involving enclosed tree plantations. Crucially, the paper states that **techniques appropriate for arid and semi-arid habitats, such as nurse species or nucleation, are rarely applied** in the Southern Cone. In contrast, the Sahel's management is often farmer and community-led, focusing on economically valuable trees to improve smallholder agriculture and address land degradation drivers like overstocking and land clearing. The paper promotes foundation plant rewilding as a strategy that promotes species autonomy and self-regulation ("passive management") while providing the conditions for greater species’ autonomy, allowing for novel ecosystem trajectories, and potentially integrating sustainable resource harvesting.</div>

This strategy shifts the restoration focus from species composition targets to recovering fundamental ecological processes using key structuring species (trees and shrubs).<br><br>For the Southern Cone, this perspective offers a robust critique of the prevailing industrial model of restoration. By emphasizing that arid-appropriate techniques like the use of nurse species are neglected, the paper indirectly validates the necessity of recognizing ecologically structuring species like *Vachellia caven*. The foundation plant model favors the recovery of naturalistic habitat structures and encourages spontaneous reassembly, differentiating it from traditional forestry or compensatory plantings. While management may still be required (e.g., control of invasives or fire), the preferred management style aims to restore functions naturally. Ultimately, recognizing and leveraging foundation plants provides a path toward functional resilience in environments heavily impacted by anthropogenic factors, defaunation, and land degradation.</div>

The area studied is located at Barra do Quarai, between the coordinates UTM 6654600 (N) 446.500 (E) 6666400 (N) 463,800 (E). The weather on the region is of type Cfa de Köeppen, with annual temperature means of 23.4 ºC and precipitation of 1300 mm. The local soils are predominantly Gleissolo Melânico Carbonático Solódico, hydromorphics and have medium texture. The survey on the vegetation covered collection in the whole area, and classification of species by vegetative habits. For the arboreal/shrub/lianas and epiphyte vegetations, 72 species were registered; 124 herbaceous species and 58 aquatic plants species. The Prosopis affinis, P.nigra and Acacia caven association, which characterize the region physiognomy, are prominence as the most expressive elements in the arboreal flora. The occurrence of Aspidosperma quebrach-blanco is restricted to the area of study. Prosopis affinis represents the most important species, being registered on all the lots, followed by Acacia caven. The Fabaceae and Myrtaceae family representatives compound most of the riparian wood of the hydro network in the Parque, and the aquatic vegetation presents more diversity in the swamps area, and in places with short streams. The Parque area represents the only environment for occurrence of P.nigra and P.affinis in Rio Grande do Sul and in Brazil.</p>

The researchers used the expedited method to inventory all vegetative habits (herbaceous, arboreal, lianas, epiphytes, and aquatic macrophytes) across the entire area, categorizing herbaceous species based on topography (lowland, slope, summit).<br><br>Results showed a total of 72 species of arboreal/shrub/lianas/epiphytes, 124 herbaceous species, and 58 aquatic macrophyte species. The woody vegetation was dominated by Fabaceae and Myrtaceae (the latter forming most of the riparian forest). Crucially, the park's characteristic vegetation physiognomy is defined by a simple association of three arboreal Fabaceae species: *Prosopis affinis*, *P. nigra*, and *Acacia caven* (Espinilho). *Acacia caven* was noted as part of the transition vegetation, often found at the edge of the riparian forest, while *Prosopis* species are strictly heliophtes restricted to drier, higher ground on Melânico Gleissolo soils. This finding reinforced that the distribution of these key species is highly dependent on edaphic factors and localized water scarcity. The park was confirmed to be the single known location in Rio Grande do Sul and Brazil where the critical association of *P. nigra* and *P. affinis* naturally occurs, highlighting the restricted and unique nature of this disjunction of Chaquenha vegetation.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors successfully compiled and updated fragmented information on the flora of the Parque Estadual do Espinilho, achieving the objective of correcting previous descriptive inaccuracies and providing necessary data for the elaboration of the Park’s Management Plan (Plano de Manejo). The research confirmed the importance of this conservation unit, whose vegetation is characterized as a 'Savana Estépica' or 'Estepe Gramíneo-Lenhosa' (Grass-Woody Steppe)—a disjunction of Chaquenha vegetation.<br><br>The final conclusions emphasized that the arboreal flora defining the park's landscape is overwhelmingly dominated by the unique association of *Prosopis affinis*, *P. nigra*, and *Acacia caven*. The study supports the view that the restricted occurrence of these species, particularly the *Prosopis* species, is fundamentally tied to specific edaphic characteristics (Gleissolo Melânico soils and localized water stress) rather than broader climatic factors. By documenting this unique, naturally occurring, and highly restricted formation defined by these thorny legumes, the study underscores the necessity of protecting this environment, recognizing its irreplaceable ecological role in the regional flora of Rio Grande do Sul and Brazil.</div>

In this paper we document these changes and report the results of tests aimed at determining the causes of these physiognomical changes. We found that livestock, leporids, introduced Mediterranean forbs and agriculture account for differences in seed dispersal and survival of A. caven and P. chilensis, which can explain the documented changes in the Chilean landscape.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study documented a significant physiognomical transformation in the Central Chilean Valley, north of Santiago, from a historical *Prosopis chilensis* (*algarrobo*) woodland to an *Acacia caven* (*espino*) savanna. Methods utilized included temporal comparisons of tree densities using aerial photographs from 1954 and 1980, size-class analysis of current tree populations, and controlled germination and survival experiments to test the differential impacts of human land use factors.<br><br>Aerial photo comparisons showed that *Prosopis* density decreased by about 50% between 1954 and 1980. Size-class analysis indicated severe recruitment failure for *P. chilensis*, as younger size classes were absent. Conversely, *A. caven* showed robust reproduction with individuals across all size classes. <br><br>Crucially, experiments demonstrated that domestic herbivores (cows and goats) act as significant selective agents. Seed germination trials revealed that passing through the gut of these animals increased *A. caven* germination rates by about five times compared to controls, functioning as a scarification/dispersal mechanism. However, for *P. chilensis*, gut passage drastically lowered germination rates (to about 20% of controls), indicating that herbivores function primarily as seed predators for this species. Livestock also removed a substantial portion of the overall *Prosopis* seed crop.<br><br>Seedling survival experiments, using plots subjected to different disturbances (control, intermediate, vineyard conversion), confirmed that removal of mammalian herbivores and exotic herbaceous cover significantly increased recruitment for both species. Furthermore, *A. caven* exhibited high resilience to agricultural disturbance (cutting and plowing) through vigorous resprouting, a capability entirely absent in *P. chilensis* within the sampling area. The study thus concluded that the shift is driven by the differential response of the two species to chronic grazing and agriculture.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the large-scale shift from *Prosopis chilensis* woodland to *Acacia caven* savanna is primarily a result of the long history of land use practices in the Central Valley, specifically the common sowing-grazing rotation practiced on the flat lands, rather than wood-cutting alone, since both species resprout vigorously after coppicing.<br><br>*Acacia caven*'s success in dominating the current landscape is attributed to its life history traits favoring survival under anthropogenic pressure. Its seeds are successfully dispersed and scarified by abundant domestic livestock, leading to high germination rates. Moreover, *A. caven* demonstrates vigorous resprouting after repeated disturbance associated with agricultural cycles (cutting and plowing).<br><br>In contrast, *Prosopis chilensis* recruitment is severely impeded by these same land use factors. Livestock consumption acts as a seed predator, significantly lowering germination rates, and *Prosopis* trees fail to resprout after agricultural disturbance, leading to recruitment failure and density reduction. The authors summarize that the indirect effects of human land use, particularly chronic grazing and agriculture, have fundamentally altered the ecological dynamics, favoring the persistence and spread of *A. caven* at the expense of *P. chilensis*, thereby explaining the profound landscape transformation.</div>

Resources and technologies available today, such as digitized collections and herbarium DNA sequencing, can help accelerate taxonomic decisions in challenging plant groups. Here we employ an integrative methodology relying exclusively on herbarium specimens to investigate species boundaries in the Neotropical Myrcia neoobscura complex (Myrtaceae). • Methods We collected morphometric data from high-resolution images of herbarium sheets and analysed them using hierarchical clustering. We posteriorly tested the obtained morpho-groups with phylogenomics using the Angiosperms353 probe kit. We also gathered phenological and geographical information from specimen labels and built phenological histograms and ecological niche models to investigate ecological differences amongst taxa. • Key Results Current circumscriptions of Myrcia arenaria, Myrcia neoglabra and Myrcia neoregeliana are confirmed in this study. Conversely, the four pieces of evidence together support Calyptranthes langsdorffii var. grandiflora, Marlierea regeliana var. parviflora and Marlierea warmingiana as separate from Myrcia marliereana, Myrcia neoriedeliana and Myrcia neoobscura, respectively, contrary to arrangements proposed by previous authors. Integrated analyses also support separation between Myrcia excoriata and two similar, undescribed taxa. • Conclusions Our data reveal the need for major changes in the systematics of the group, with recognition of 12 species. The successful delivery of our study aims was possible due to obtaining robust, high-quality data from museum specimens. We emphasize the importance of maintaining botanical collections physically and digitally available for taxonomic work and advocate their use to accelerate taxonomic solutions of tropical species complexes hollistically. This is urgent, given the paucity of funds for fieldwork and unprecedented rates of habitat loss in the tropics.</p>

For **Autopolyploid formation**, fire induces stress: high temperatures (30–50°C soil temperatures, common in surface fires) can disrupt meiosis and lead to unreduced gamete (UG) formation. Additionally, chemical stressors, such as mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) released in smoke, cause spindle fiber aberrations, while liberated heavy metals and radioactive ions also induce mutations.<br><br>For **Allopolyploid formation**, fire often triggers synchronized post-fire flowering, which increases the chances of interspecific hybridization, especially in resprouter groups like grasses and geophytes. This enhanced hybridization, sometimes facilitated by fire-induced UG formation, promotes allopolyploidization. <br><br>Regarding **Establishment and Persistence**, fire plays a dual ecological role. Short-term effects include rapid recycling of burned biomass, increasing available soil nutrients (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) necessary for the initial establishment and growth of newly formed, nutrient-demanding polyploids. Long-term effects center on selection: fire acts as a strong ecological filter, selecting for stress-tolerant polyploids. Crucially, recurrent fire helps polyploid lineages overcome **Minority Cytotype Exclusion (MCE)** by providing a stochastic cue for synchronized formation. Fire regimes also select for the perennial resprouting life history, which ensures individual longevity, allows mutations to accumulate, and reduces mating bottlenecks, thereby promoting persistence.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that fire regimes are highly likely to be a crucial, underappreciated driver of polyploid ecology and evolution globally. They predict that frequent, low-intensity surface fire regimes—such as those dominating tropical grasslands and savannas (with short fire return periods, e.g., 1–2 years)—should exhibit the highest polyploidy rates. These conditions optimize temperature-induced UG formation and strongly select for perennial resprouting life forms, which are adapted to overcome MCE.<br><br>They suggest that examining polyploidy patterns across grasslands that vary in both cold exposure and fire frequency would help isolate the relative importance of these two major agents. The expectation that cold, fire-prone places (like the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga, shown in Box 1) would have the highest polyploidy instances is supported by existing data, suggesting cold and fire often act synergistically, both promoting resprouting life forms and providing nutrient pulses.<br><br>Given the rise of the 'Pyrocene' (increasing global fire frequency and intensity), the authors emphasize the urgency of experimental work to test specific fire-related mechanisms (intensity, nutrient availability, UG formation rates, and life history traits) to better understand fire's substantial role in shaping plant diversification and biogeographic patterns.</div>

Via a meta-analysis, we quantiﬁed savanna woody vegetation change spanning the last century. We found a global trend of woody encroachment that was established prior the 1980s. However, there is critical regional variation in the magnitude of encroachment. Woody cover is increasing most rapidly in the remaining uncleared savannas of South America, most likely due to ﬁre suppression and land fragmentation. In contrast, Aus- tralia has experienced low rates of encroachment. When accounting for land use, African savannas have a mean rate annual woody cover increase two and a half times that of Australian savannas. In Africa, encroachment occurs across multiple land uses and is accelerating over time. In Africa and Australia, rising atmospheric CO2, changing land management and rainfall are likely causes. We argue that the functional traits of each woody ﬂora, speciﬁcally the N-ﬁxing ability and architecture of woody plants, are critical to predicting encroachment over the next century and that African savannas are at high risk of widespread vegetation change.</p>

The methodology involved compiling data from 94 studies covering 110 savanna sites, focusing on natural tropical and subtropical C4 grass-dominated systems, excluding areas subject to large-scale agriculture or afforestation/deforestation. Woody cover, biomass, or basal area recorded at two or more time points were used to calculate an annual increment of cover change. Basal area was converted to percent cover for Brazilian and Australian sites using established linear regressions.<br><br>The authors extracted metadata including climatic information (Mean Annual Precipitation, MAP), dominant land use (conservation, commercial/communal grazing, remnant), and functional traits of encroaching species, particularly recording N-fixing ability for plants in the Fabaceae family. Statistical analysis utilized Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), comparing candidate models using AICc, to test the effects of initial woody cover, continent, MAP, and study start year.<br><br>Results confirmed a global trend of woody encroachment in 84% of sites, established prior to the 1980s. Crucial regional variation was noted: Australia showed the lowest average rate (0.1% per year), while South America (Brazil) exhibited the highest mean rate of woody cover increase (0.7% per year, or 7% per decade). This rapid increase in South America was attributed primarily to fire suppression and land fragmentation. African savannas showed an average increase of 0.25% per year, accelerating over time, with rates 2.5 times higher than Australia when accounting for land use. The analysis found that local land use, such as heavy grazing and consequent reductions in fire frequency, promotes encroachment.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study concludes that woody encroachment is a widespread symptom of alterations in ecosystem processes across the savanna biome, driven by global factors like rising atmospheric CO2 interacting critically with regional drivers such as changing land management, rainfall patterns, and the functional traits of the local woody flora. The rates of change are highly contingent on location and land-use history, leading to significant regional variation in the magnitude of encroachment.<br><br>Specifically, the authors argue that the functional traits of the encroaching species, particularly their N-fixing ability and architecture, are critical parameters for predicting the magnitude of vegetation change in the future. While global drivers like elevated CO2 can accelerate plant growth by increasing water-use efficiency, local factors such as fire suppression and heavy grazing facilitate encroachment by releasing woody plants from competition. The high rates observed in South America due to fire suppression and fragmentation, alongside accelerating encroachment in Africa, highlight that these regions face a high risk of widespread vegetation change. Understanding the interplay between land use, environmental setting, and species-specific traits is essential for predicting and managing the future state of the savanna biome.</div>

However, our understanding of such dynamics today is often limited by the availability of reliable and detailed land-cover information in the past, before the onset of remote sensing technologies. In this study, we carefully extracted information from historical maps of the Caldenal savannas of central Argentina in the 1880s to generate a woody cover map that we compared to a 2000s dataset. Over about the last 120 years, woody cover increased across approximately 12,200 km2 (14.2% of the area). During the same period, about 5,000 km2 of the original woody area was converted to croplands and around 7,000 km2 to pastures, about the same total land area as was affected by encroachment. A smaller area, ﬁne-scale analysis between the 1960s and the 2000s revealed that tree cover increased overall by 27%, shifting from open savannas to a mosaic of dense woodlands along with additional agricultural clearings. Statistical models indicate that woody cover dynamics in this region were affected by a combination of environmental and human factors. Over about the last 120 years, increases in woody plant cover have stored signif-icant amounts of C (95.9 TgC), but not enough to compensate for losses from conversions to crop-lands and pastures (166.7 TgC), generating a regional net loss of 70.9 TgC. C losses could be even larger in the future if, as predicted, energy crops such as switchgrass, would trigger a new land-cover change phase in this region.</p>

The researchers leveraged historical maps from systematic land surveys conducted in the 1880s to create a baseline woody cover map, employing a 'Points method' grid along township perimeters. This baseline was contrasted with modern land-cover data from the early 2000s National Forest Inventory.<br><br>Regionally, the results showed massive, simultaneous land-cover shifts. Woody plant encroachment (WPE) led to an increase in woody cover across 12,200 km² (14.2% of the study area). Concurrently, an almost identical total area (12,000 km²) of original woody cover was cleared and converted, specifically 5,000 km² to croplands and 7,000 km² to pastures. A finer-scale analysis comparing 1960s aerial photographs to 2000s CBERS images confirmed a 27% increase in tree cover overall, transforming open savannas into a mosaic of dense woodlands and agricultural clearings.<br><br>Statistical modeling indicated that these woody cover dynamics were driven by a combination of environmental variables and human factors, including local land use, the introduction of cattle, and changes in fire regimes. Crucially, the analysis of carbon stocks revealed that while WPE resulted in significant C storage (95.9 TgC), the C losses from conversion to agriculture (166.7 TgC) far exceeded this gain, resulting in a net regional carbon loss of 70.9 TgC.

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the Argentine savannas are defined by highly active and simultaneous processes of woody plant encroachment and agricultural conversion. WPE, linked predominantly to human factors like the introduction of livestock and altered fire regimes, results in a shift toward denser woody cover and associated C sequestration. However, the expansive agricultural frontier aggressively cleared vast areas for crops and pastures.<br><br>The most significant consequence of these simultaneous dynamics is a net negative impact on regional carbon stocks. The substantial C losses caused by converting native woodlands to agriculture (166.7 TgC) could not be offset by the C stored through WPE (95.9 TgC), resulting in a net loss of 70.9 TgC over the 120-year period. The study highlights the vulnerability of the Caldenal ecosystem, concluding that future land-cover changes driven by economic pressures, such as the potential expansion of energy crops like switchgrass, pose an ongoing risk of further substantial C losses and ecosystem degradation.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">The coastal region of eastern Uruguay has a native and endangered ecosystem with Butia palms called butiazais. In order to find out about the formation of this vegetation, a multi-proxy study was done to analyse two sedimentary cores from this region, at Laguna de Castillos and Laguna Negra. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the analysed sediments were deposited over the last 12,000 years. The phytoliths, charcoal, sediments and geochemistry were studied to reconstruct environmental dynamics, showing the main geomorphological, climatic and ecological changes. The data suggest a complex interaction between the climate, sea level changes, vegetation dynamics and fires. At the Pleistocene–Holocene transition the climate was cold and wet, and trees and palms expanded accompanied by limited local fires with some evidence of regional fires. The temperature and precipitation increased in the early to mid-Holocene, coinciding with the Post-Glacial Marine Transgression (PMT) that led to a reduction in trees and Butia palms due to edaphic changes. Fire activity during this period suggests an interplay between vegetation changes and climate. In the late Holocene there was a change from C3 to C4 plants indicated by isotope data, with increased fire activity from natural and human causes. The expansion of grasslands probably led to fire-prone conditions, even with a wetter climate. The results provide new insights into the response of coastal ecosystems to past climatic events, with implications for predicting future environmental responses to ongoing climate change.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The researchers conducted a multi-proxy study on two sedimentary cores (U01 and U02) from coastal Uruguay, covering the last 12,000 years, to reconstruct the environmental history and the development of the native *Butia* palm ecosystem (*butiazais*). The methodologies included radiocarbon dating, particle size analysis, phytolith and sponge spicule analysis (using indices like Pa/P for palm abundance and D/P for tree cover), and fire proxies (micro/macrocharcoal, PAHs). Stable isotope analysis of carbonates provided data on vegetation types (C3 vs. C4 plants).<br><br>Results revealed dynamic ecosystem changes. During the Pleistocene–Holocene transition, cold/wet conditions favored the expansion of trees and palms, with limited fire. The early to mid-Holocene saw warmer and wetter conditions, but the Post-Glacial Marine Transgression (PMT) caused edaphic changes (likely salinization) that resulted in a reduction of trees and *Butia* palms, demonstrating that sea level/soil conditions sometimes override climatic trends. The late Holocene was characterized by a shift from C3 to C4 dominance, signifying grassland expansion. This change, alongside increasing fire activity attributed explicitly to both **natural and human causes**, led to fire-prone conditions. The overall finding is a complex interaction where geomorphology, climate, fire, and human activity shaped the fate of these palms.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study concludes that the development and current state of the *butiazais* are defined by a complex interplay of environmental factors and anthropogenic influence throughout the Holocene. A key finding is that the expansion of *Butia* palms was not synchronous with early Holocene climate warming; rather, it was curtailed by local edaphic changes caused by the Post-Glacial Marine Transgression (PMT). <br><br>Crucially, the late Holocene record indicates increasing human involvement, specifically linked to higher fire activity, alongside natural processes. The current threat faced by these palms—a significant reduction in extent and a lack of regeneration—is directly linked back to contemporary 'environmental changes and human land management.' By providing a detailed timeline of how the coastal ecosystem responded to past events (like sea-level change and shifting fire regimes), the research aims to inform conservation strategies necessary to protect the endangered *butiazais* from future climate change impacts.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">1. South American subtropical landscapes are dominated by open grasslands and mosaics of forest–grassland formations. Forests are often restricted to riverine margins with sharp forest–grassland ecotones. Understanding the mechanisms maintaining forest–grassland ecotones is important to anticipate the effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on the extent of these biomes and the ecosystem services they provide. 2. We used a combination of field surveys and long- term field experiments to explore the mechanisms that explain tree cover expansion at the ecotone of riverine forests and grasslands in central Uruguay, within the South American Campos. We assessed the role of tree seed dispersal and seedling establishment limitations, and experimentally tested for the effects of cattle, nurse tree cover and grasses on the recruitment of forest and grassland tree species at the forest– grassland ecotone. 3. We found that forest expansion depends on the interplay between cattle and nurse trees. Vachellia caven trees colonize the grassland successfully and facilitate the formation of forest patches by enhancing seed accumulation and seedling establishment of forest tree species. Surprisingly, grass cover had mostly positive effects on early seedling survival of forest tree seedlings. However, cattle limits tree seedling growth and survival, especially of forest tree species. This results in a nucleated vegetation pattern of tree patches that ultimately limits forest expansion. 4. Synthesis and applications. Tree cover can potentially expand on the subtropical South American grasslands. Reductions in cattle densities and increases in rainfall levels associated with climate change could facilitate forest expansion in this region.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study investigated the mechanisms governing tree cover expansion at the forest-grassland ecotone in the South American Campos (central Uruguay) using combined field surveys and long-term experiments. The field surveys quantified the structure and composition of 1744 tree patches, ranging from solitary trees to large patches, and assessed seed rain and soil seed banks across these habitats. Functional traits like SLA, leaf toughness, and spinescence were measured to explore recruitment success.<br><br>Results showed that *Vachellia caven* is the dominant solitary tree initiating colonization in the grassland. Crucially, the study confirmed that *Vachellia caven* acts as an effective nurse plant, successfully enhancing both seed accumulation and the subsequent seedling establishment of forest tree species, thereby initiating the formation of multi-specific tree patches.<br><br>Experimental results identified the main constraints on forest expansion. While grass cover surprisingly had positive effects on early seedling survival, cattle browsing proved to be the major limiting factor. Cattle significantly reduced the growth and survival of tree seedlings, particularly those belonging to forest species. This dynamic—facilitation by nurse trees coupled with intensive limitation by cattle—results in a characteristic 'nucleated vegetation pattern' that prevents the widespread, continuous expansion of the forest boundary.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that forest expansion in the subtropical South American grasslands is critically dependent on the interaction between facilitation (provided by nurse trees like *Vachellia caven*) and high levels of disturbance (caused by cattle grazing). *Vachellia caven* plays a fundamental role in ecological succession by overcoming establishment limitations for less hardy forest species, validating its importance as a pioneer and facilitator species.<br><br>However, chronic cattle grazing intercepts this successional pathway. Herbivory limits the growth and survival of recruiting trees, preventing the coalescing of patches and thereby maintaining the sharp forest-grassland ecotone and the nucleated pattern of tree cover.<br><br>The synthesis suggests that tree cover possesses the potential for widespread expansion into these grasslands. The authors emphasize that this expansion is primarily constrained by anthropogenic disturbance, not climate or competition. Therefore, implementing management practices focused on reductions in cattle densities is crucial for allowing tree cover to expand and for the effective conservation and restoration of these forest systems. They also suggest that climate change (increased rainfall) could synergistically facilitate this expansion if grazing is controlled.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">1.  Importance of nurse plants structuring plant communities is well- appreciated at
local scales, yet the effect of a single nurse on large scales has been neglected
in analyses. So far, studies only use environmental gradients within one type of
ecosystem and tend to generalize the nurse effects. 2. To assess how the effect of a single nurse species is modulated by different environ-
mental settings, interactions between the shrub Vachellia caven and the surrounding
plant communities were evaluated at 481 paired plots (outside vs. underneath the
plant crown), in 39 sites across two distribution ranges, the Mediterranean west and
the mostly subtropical east of the Andes Mountains (covering ca. 2 × 106 km2).
3. Cover, abundance and richness of perennial plants underneath and outside V.
caven were used as response variables to estimate an index indicative of plant
interactions (relative interaction index [RII]) and tested how this was affected by
the rainfall gradient and distribution range. 4. Overall, RII responses to rainfall gradients had low conditional R2 (~0.25) in this
large scale of analysis, but were significantly different between ranges: the RII
followed a quadratic trend across the rainfall gradient in the western range, while
this relationship was positive and close to linear at the eastern range. 5. Then, by projecting the RII models (i.e. for abundance, cover and richness) spa-
tially through a consensus map, we show that most positive effects of V. caven are
geographically found in dissimilar areas: the central part of Chile (western range)
and across the Paraná River (eastern range). 6. When local fine- scale predictors (i.e. annual herbs' cover and height, and herbi-
vores' faeces cover) were used to model each response variable at the plot level
(underneath or outside V. caven), we observed similar trends as when we consid-
ered only the large- scale predictors. 7. Synthesis. Here, we show that the effect of the same nurse species on neighbour-
ing plant communities can be very different depending on ranges of distribution,
stressing that its ecological function cannot be generalized and not only depends
on local factors but also is large- scale context- dependent.</p>

The study area spanned approximately $2 \times 10^6 \text{ km}^2$, encompassing two major distribution ranges separated by the Andes: the Mediterranean western range (Chile) and the mostly subtropical eastern range (Argentina and Paraguay).<br><br>The researchers calculated the Relative Interaction Index (RII) to quantify the net ecological effect. They tested RII response against large-scale variables (rainfall gradient, distribution range) and fine-scale variables (local herb cover, height, and herbivores' faeces cover). Results indicated that while the overall RII models had low explanatory power at this massive scale (conditional $R^2 \approx 0.25$), the interaction patterns were significantly different between the two ranges. In the western range, the RII displayed a quadratic (humped) trend against the rainfall gradient, aligning with modified Stress Gradient Hypothesis predictions. Crucially for the thesis, the eastern range exhibited a positive and nearly linear relationship between RII and rainfall, suggesting consistent facilitation under wetter conditions.<br><br>Spatially projecting these RII models showed that the most substantial positive effects of *V. caven* were concentrated in geographically distinct areas: central Chile (western range) and across the Paraná River (eastern range).

Em vista das poucas informações sobre seus recursos naturais, o presente estudo objetiva inventariar a flora vascular, descrever, identificar e quantificar as principais fitofisionomias nativas e antrópicas e discutir a relevância dessas informações para a conservação da biodiversidade em escala regional no bioma. Os principais tipos fitofisionômicos foram localizados e identificados em fotografias aéreas utilizando critérios básicos de fotointerpretação, com verificações e correções feitas em campo, sendo, nessa etapa, ainda caracterizadas pelos modos de vida das espécies mais densas, pelo ambiente em que se encontram e pelo estado de conservação de cada fitofisionomia. Nas formações florestais, foram realizadas coletas botânicas. Foram definidas cinco fitofisionomias naturais e três antrópicas subdivididas em 10 subtipos fisionômicos distintos. A cobertura atual de florestas nativas na PIRP é de 4.376,83 ha, sendo a segunda maior área remanescente no litoral do Pampa. Nessas florestas, foram inventariadas 199 espécies vasculares, distribuídas entre 146 gêneros e 71 famílias, com espécies incluídas na categoria de ameaçadas, com distribuição restrita na região ou endêmicas. Na PIRP, estiveram representadas as principais fitofisionomias da região costeira do Pampa.

This error is blamed on a primary failure of adequate sampling, possibly concentrating efforts only in small areas like the "Algarrobal."<br><br>For the Quaraí River Hydrographic Basin (Table 2), the errors are deemed "even more serious and unjustifiable." The IFC-RS claimed 28.73 *P. nigra* trees/ha (making it the fifth most abundant) and 27.27 *V. caven* trees/ha. The authors categorically reject this, noting that *P. nigra* is extremely rare, if not absent, in the vast majority of the basin, having never been found outside the ecologically small Pontal do Quaraí, where most natural vegetation has been replaced by rice paddies. The extrapolation suggests over a million *P. nigra* trees in the basin, confirming the data as fictional.<br><br>The most damning evidence is the discovery that the percentage ratio of *Prosopis affinis* abundance to *Prosopis nigra* abundance is exactly 56.3% (with decimal precision) in both the Espinilho Park data (Table 1) and the Quaraí Basin data (Table 2). This "extremely strange coincidence" proves that the flawed sample data from the small Park area was transposed (fabricated) to represent the entire large Hydrographic Basin, rendering the latter chapter entirely unreliable.</div>

This highlights a profound failure of the official inventory to accurately reflect the widespread natural ecological reality of key Pampas woody species. The authors challenge the IFC-RS creators to provide the geographic coordinates of the sample areas that supposedly generated the questionable data for the Quaraí Basin, asserting that such highly abundant *Prosopis nigra* areas simply do not exist there.

Specifically, Rambo assigned the common name "nhanduvaí" (which belongs to *P. affinis*) to the species *Vachellia caven* (misidentified taxonomically as *Acacia farnesiana*). Critically, Rambo described this species as widespread and noted its aggressive behavior, stating it was "Invading os campos, constitui... pequenos parques muito prejudiciais às pastagens" (Invading the fields, constitutes... small parks very harmful to pastures).<br><br>Conversely, Rambo applied the name "algarrobo" (which corresponds to another species, *Prosopis nigra*, not typically found there) to *Prosopis affinis*, accurately describing its unique morphology and restricted distribution in the area of Barra do Quaraí, a location he failed to fully explore before the first edition of his book. The term "Parque Espinilho," coined by Rambo and subsequently formalized in state conservation law, was incorrectly applied to this vegetation singularity dominated by *P. affinis*, when geographically and compositionally, the term should refer to the widespread *Espinillal* dominated by *V. caven*.</div>

The first, extending from indigenous presence through the Jesuit missions (1626) and subsequent extensive cattle ranching (including the Estância de Japeju) until the decline of the 'Charqueada' industry in the 1930s, had a "relatively small" environmental impact. This pastoral economy relied fundamentally on the maintenance of native fields and 'parques naturais' (arboreal formations).<br><br>The second cycle began around 1937 with the rise of intensive irrigated rice agriculture (lavoura orizícola). This shift was facilitated by favorable local conditions (flat lands, abundant water from the Uruguay and Quaraí rivers, and new railway links). The text notes that this agricultural expansion led to the "drastic modification" of the landscape through the suppression of vast portions of native fields and the arboreal vegetation of the natural parks. The authors highlight that the growth of rice farming fundamentally replaced the historical agro-pastoral activities that had previously defined the region's economy.<br><br>The historical narrative establishes the context for why conservation measures were necessary: the native vegetation, including the unique formations of Inhanduvá (*Vachellia caven*) and Algarrobo, faced imminent loss. The creation of the Espinilho State Park and legal protection for Inhanduvá were crucial reactions to this intense land conversion.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The central objective of this article is to analyze the origin of the official name of the Espinilho State Park and describe the existing vegetation typologies, addressing phytogeographical inaccuracies prevalent in the literature. The authors meticulously trace the origin of the name 'Parque Espinilho' back to Balduíno Rambo (1942), who was influenced by Lindman (1906).<br><br>Key to the discussion is the historical confusion surrounding the identity of two major Chacoan trees. Rambo, during a brief 1941 visit to Barra do Quaraí, mistakenly identified *Vachellia caven* (the true 'espinilho') as 'nhandu vaí' and *Prosopis affinis* (the true 'inhanduvá') as 'algarrobo.' Although Rambo later corrected these common names in a 1946 report, the original confusing binomials persisted in his influential work, leading to the misleading designation of the park.<br><br>The authors differentiate between two distinct silvático-campestres typologies:<br>1. **Parque de Inhanduvá (or Nandubaysal):** Found in Barra do Quaraí (the location of the state park), characterized by the dominance of *Prosopis affinis* and *Vachellia caven*, typically associated with localized sandy/sedimentary formations.<br>2. **Parque de Espinilhos (or Espinillal):** Dominated essentially by *Vachellia caven* alone. The authors note that these 'true' *Parques de Espinilhos* are widespread across the Campanha and other central regions of Rio Grande do Sul because *V. caven* is not linked to specific sedimentary formations, unlike *P. affinis*.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The article concludes that the official designation 'Parque Estadual do Espinilho' is inadequate and results from a historical error and 'careless reading' of Balduíno Rambo's foundational work. Rambo, despite being the most important botanist in the region, failed to adequately revise his text to correct the initial misidentification of *Vachellia caven* and *Prosopis affinis* nomenclature.<br><br>The official name is deemed inappropriate because the vegetation singularity of the conservation unit in Barra do Quaraí is defined by the prevalence of *Prosopis affinis* (inhanduvá). Therefore, the park should more accurately be named 'Parque de Inhanduvá,' a suggestion previously championed by other researchers. The designation 'Parque Espinilho' inaccurately applies a name strictly corresponding to *V. caven*-dominated areas (Espinillares), which, although widespread, do not characterize the unique ecological structure that the conservation unit was established to protect. The article highlights how this flawed nomenclature inadvertently enshrines a scientific error.</div>

Geographically, *V. ibirocayensis* is likely endemic to the southwest of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), restricted to stony grasslands and ravines near the Ibirocai rivers.<br><br>**Conservation:** The authors noted that the species' populations are highly fragmented and contain few individuals.

The axial parenchyma is visible to the naked eye, abundant, paratracheal, and organized in irregular, predominantly tangential bands (zoned and confluent).<br><br>Microscopically, the wood is characterized by very numerous, small vessels (17–56/mm²), mostly in radial multiples and clusters. Vessel elements are very short (average 221 µm) with simple perforation plates. Axial parenchyma is abundant (~27% of volume), typically arranged in series of 2, rarely 3 or 4 cells. Romboidal calcium oxalate crystals are notable, occurring in two sizes: small (~25 µm) and large (up to 80 µm). Rays are numerous (6–11/mm), homogeneous, and predominantly multiseriate (often greater than 4 cells wide). Fibers are libriform, non-septate, short (average 953 µm), and thin-walled (~3.4 µm). The anatomical structure closely resembles *V. caven* and *V. ibirocayensis*.</div>

This specific structure allows for easy identification of the genus *Vachellia*, distinguishing it from all other species of the former genus *Acacia* native to Rio Grande do Sul.<br><br>Quantitative analysis is necessary to differentiate among the three native species. *V. farnesiana* can be separated from *V. caven* by its longer vessel elements (221 µm vs. 167 µm) and more numerous rays (9/mm vs. 6/mm). Both species share rays that are predominantly wider than 4 cells and the presence of large romboidal crystals in the axial parenchyma (up to 80 µm).<br><br>In contrast, *V. ibirocayensis* is distinct from both *V. farnesiana* and *V. caven* due to its predominantly uniseriate rays and the presence of only small romboidal crystals (~25 µm) in the axial parenchyma.</div>

This confirmation relies on historical documentation dating back to the early 20th century and contemporary botanical fieldwork.<br><br>Field visits in 2009 confirmed the presence of *P. affinis* in a sedimentary soil lens, approximately 5.5 km in diameter, isolated within the predominantly volcanic (meláfiro) soils typical of the Campanha Plateau. A genuine "parque de inhanduvá" was found here, containing dozens of old trees and scarce regeneration, alongside a few individuals of *Vachellia caven* (espinilhos). Notably, the herbaceous layer under the canopy lacked *Andropogon lateralis* (capim-caninha), which dominated the surrounding open grasslands, suggesting a localized modifying ecological effect by the woody vegetation.<br><br>The paper addresses significant phytogeographical controversies, particularly clarifying the historical confusion arising from Balduíno Rambo's use of popular names. The authors clarify that Rambo utilized the term "Parque Espinilho" broadly to designate various park-like vegetations, not solely the *P. affinis* and *V. caven* association found near Barra do Quaraí. They establish that the true *P. affinis* is restricted to sedimentary formations, explaining the disjunction (about 100 km) between the Quaraí population and the known Espinilho State Park population, due to the intervening unsuitable volcanic bedrock (Neossolos Regolíticos).</div>

The disjunct distribution across the Campanha Gaúcha is attributed to specific lithopedological factors, namely the necessity for sedimentary or deep alluvial soils, which are rare amidst the widespread volcanic formations. The paper thus provides a crucial revision of the phytogeography of this important woody species in the Pampas/Campanha ecosystem, challenging the notion of its limited presence and confirming the long-term, native establishment of park-like woody formations.</div>

The structure is described as a 'park' containing about 50 adult trees of varied height and diameter, exhibiting an inequiânea (uneven-aged) distribution, characteristic of natural vegetation. The herbaceous stratum is noted to be severely degraded due to intense cattle grazing ("pisoteio do gado"), leading to the absence of dominant native grasses and the abundance of ruderal species (indicators of intense anthropism).<br><br>The historical analysis thoroughly investigates the periods of Jesuit missions (1627–1767) and subsequent Spanish/Portuguese estância management, concluding that neither indigenous groups nor missionaries/settlers would have introduced the species. This is based on mission objectives (focused on cattle), lack of cultural records of valuing *P. affinis*, the difficulty in cultivating the slow-growing species, and the need to protect it from herbivory. Crucially, the authors note the absence of other common Chacoan elements usually associated with *P. affinis* stands, such as *Vachellia caven* (Espinilho) and *Prosopis nigra* (Algarrobo), at this specific site.</div>

This conclusion is derived from the convergence of structural evidence—specifically the irregular distribution (non-standardized spacing) and the presence of very old, large individuals showing an uneven-aged structure—and the historical context, which effectively rules out human introduction during known periods of settlement or land use.<br><br>This finding significantly extends the validated natural distribution range of *P. affinis* to the center-west of Rio Grande do Sul, supporting the broader phytogeographical perspective that these thorny woody species are more widespread in the Campos Sulinos (Pampas) than some restrictive views allow. The authors implicitly reinforce the need to recognize and protect these native woody fragments, which face constant degradation from intensive land use like cattle grazing.</div>

The site is located on a gentle hill with Argissolo Bruno Acinzentado soil (Acrisol) under a Cfa climate.<br><br>**Methods:** Researchers collected fertile branches for botanical confirmation and used field measurements for morphometric analysis. Key measurements included total height (H) and height to the first bifurcation (L, base of the crown) using a telescopic ruler, Diameter at Breast Height (DAP) using a diametric tape, and crown projection radii in four cardinal directions (No, Le, Sul, Oe) to calculate mean crown diameter (Dc) and area (Ac). Derived variables such as Crown Height (Hc), Crown Percentage (Pc), Crown Formal (Fc), and Trunk Slenderness Degree (GE) were calculated. Spatial positioning was determined using a 30m tape measure and GPS (Garmin Map 60 CSx). Statistical analysis employed SPSS for descriptive statistics and regression analysis (DAP vs. H; DAP vs. Ac).<br><br>**Results:** Botanically, the collected material corresponded perfectly to *P. affinis*. Morphometrically, the trees demonstrated superior dimensions compared to regional and Platine literature. Total height (H) ranged from 2.89 m to 8.5 m, with a mean of 5.20 m—significantly higher than other regional populations like the Parque Estadual do Espinilho. DAP ranged from 8.9 cm to an unprecedented 74.0 cm (mean 35.7 cm). Nine individuals exceeded 50 cm DAP. This maximum DAP far surpasses the previously accepted maximums (40–50 cm) in literature for the species in the Platine region. The crown percentage (Pc) averaged 71.70%, reaching up to 97.11%, demonstrating tall, developed crowns. Crown morphology was noted for its variability, ranging from hemispherical to umbrella-shaped, differing from the 'flattened' or 'corymbiform' standards often cited.</div>

The maximum recorded DAP (74.0 cm) significantly exceeds the morphological maximums cited for the species throughout the Platine literature.<br><br>Crucially, the authors interpret the trees' large size and probable advanced age as strong evidence supporting the **natural origin** of this occurrence in São Vicente do Sul. This inference is reinforced by the lack of historical documentation regarding the introduction of the species by human intervention, whether by indigenous populations or European settlers.<br><br>This study challenges the generalized descriptions of *P. affinis* often found in botanical literature, which may be based on studies of smaller, potentially younger or disturbed populations. The unique diversity in the crown structure (varying widely, especially among older trees) further highlights a broader natural fisionomic range than previously recognized. Defining these natural, maximum morphometric limits is deemed essential for future dendrological and ecological understanding of the species.</div>

The study incorporates historical evidence, citing an early record from 1922 and local toponymy ('Fazenda Inhanduvá,' dating to 1840) to support the species' native status and long-term presence in the area, countering the view that it is restricted to the far west of the state.<br><br>Results confirm the existence of fragmented stands, mainly located on the "Fazenda Inhanduvá," characterized by high biological diversity including numerous epiphytes (Tillandsia, Pleopeltis, Oncidium) and co-occurring arboreal species. Critically, the study documents severe ecosystem degradation: the parks have been largely replaced by rice paddies ("parque que cedeu lugar a lavouras de arroz, em sua quase totalidade"). The remaining fragments, particularly those isolated in agricultural areas, are highly threatened. The physical alteration of the environment by cultivation compromises the trees' ability to survive, leading to their "morte paulatina" (gradual death). The consistent association of *P. affinis* with alluvial sediments across these new, disjunct sites reinforces their relictual nature and suggests the Ibicuí river valley as a historic migratory route.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The confirmation of *Prosopis affinis* in Rosário do Sul considerably expands the species' distribution in Rio Grande do Sul, reinforcing the argument against restrictive narratives regarding its native range. This extension provides crucial data for understanding the biogeography of the Espinhal Province. The authors assert that the natural origin of these stands is undeniable, supported by historical records dating back to 1922 and local oral tradition, validating the species' endemic role.<br><br>The findings highlight that these stands possess a relictual character, strongly associated with alluvial sedimentary formations. This pattern of disjunct occurrence, far east of previously acknowledged limits, points toward the Ibicuí river basin as a significant dispersal corridor from the western region of the state.<br><br>Ultimately, the study serves as a documentation of significant ecosystem degradation caused by intensive land use. The authors stress that agricultural expansion, specifically rice farming, has nearly annihilated these natural parks. The remaining fragments are acutely endangered, as soil cultivation fundamentally alters the ecological conditions necessary for the trees' survival. The research underscores the urgent need to recognize and conserve these 'true natural parks' of Inhanduvá, crucial components of the regional ecology currently being lost due to human activity.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study describes the sixth natural stand of *Prosopis affinis* (Inhanduvá) identified in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), located on the floodplain of the Ibicuí river in the municipality of Cacequi, known as Fazenda Santa Fé. Geographically, the park is long (c. 1500m) and narrow (50 to 300m), situated at 86m altitude, and isolated from the river by small lakes and ciliar forest remnants. The terrain is sedimentary, composed of alluvial deposits, classified as Planossolo Háplico Eutrófico Arênico, common to floodplains.<br><br>Floristically, the stand contains large-sized *P. affinis* individuals, along with a rich assemblage of species derived from the adjacent riparian forest, including various trees (*Sebastiania commersoniana*, *Coccoloba brasiliensis*), lianas, and abundant epiphytes (notably *Cereus hildmannianus* and several *Tillandsia* species). The stand showed higher floristic diversity (arboreal species, epiphytes, lianas, hemiparasitas) compared to the previously studied várzea of the Santa Maria River. Importantly, it lacked classic Chaco elements (e.g., *Prosopis nigra*, *Aspidosperma quebrachoblanco*), distinguishing it from stands closer to the extreme west of RS.<br><br>The discovery of this new, disjunct park, alongside others previously described (Jarau, Loreto, Santa Maria River), is presented as definitive evidence refuting outdated bibliographic limitations that confined *P. affinis* distribution solely to the area around the Parque Estadual do Espinilho. This occurrence strongly supports the hypothesis that the sedimentary floodplains of the Ibicuí river function as a key immigratory route for the species, allowing its expansion into the interior of the state by circumventing the Planalto da Campanha.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the vegetation represents a genuine natural stand of Inhanduvá, characterized by spontaneous formation and lack of regular spacing. They detail the key ecological process at play: *Prosopis affinis* acts as a **pioneer tree** (*árvore pioneira*), facilitating the recruitment and growth of ciliar forest species (like *angico*). As these taller species grow, the resulting shading compromises the survival of *P. affinis* individuals within the park's interior structure, leading to their localized disappearance.<br><br>However, this dynamic process ensures the species' persistence, as *P. affinis* simultaneously colonizes adjacent fields under favorable edaphic conditions (Figure 2B). This spatial shift confirms the species' reliance on dynamic pioneer conditions. The primary threat identified to this ecological stability is the potential conversion of the adjacent floodplain várzea for agricultural use, specifically rice cultivation. To guarantee the preservation of the species and its associated dynamic process, the authors issue a formal recommendation that a strip of land adjacent to the park should be protected from agricultural utilization. Finally, the finding reiterates that the Ibicuí river valley, due to its unique geomorphology as a sedimentary pathway, served as the essential immigratory route for the species across the region.</div>

This area is characterized by sedimentary Planos solo Háplico Eutrófico Arênico and a Cfa climate.<br><br>This discovery marks the fourth such park described in the Ibicuí basin, lending substantial support to the interpretation of the Ibicuí river valley as a crucial migratory route for woody species moving into the center of Rio Grande do Sul. This finding directly challenges older phytogeographical narratives that limited the natural occurrence of Inhanduvá to the extreme southwest of the state (like the Parque Estadual do Espinilho).<br><br>The described park, although geographically isolated and small (1100m long, up to 400m wide), is confirmed to be a remnant of natural origin, hosting hundreds of mature and regenerating *P. affinis* individuals.

The park is "severely threatened by rice cultivation" (*lavoura arrozeira*), resulting in numerous dead trees and partial exposure of root systems due to erosion from stream overflow. Furthermore, the abundance of *capim anoni* (*Eragrostis plana*) in the understory is cited as a "clear indication of anthropism" (*claro indício de antropismo*), linking the site degradation to intensive land use practices (likely grazing, given the indicator species).</div>

By documenting *Vachellia caven* as a component of this severely threatened, natural relict, the study supports the narrative that these woody formations are indigenous to the Pampas interior and are being lost due to land conversion and degradation, rather than being invasive species.</div>

The study justifies its necessity by pointing out that previous literature often misrepresented or underestimated the true geographical distribution of *B. yatay* in the state.<br><br>Phytogeographically, the palm grove is confirmed as a natural occurrence, representing an important disjunction from the species' main distribution center in the Argentine Mesopotamia. Following Cabrera & Willink's classification, the area is inserted into the Inhanduvá District and Espinal Province, characterized by sandy-stony (areno-pedregosos) soils, which are isolated by typical volcanic rocks of the Campanha Plateau.<br><br>The Coatepe Palm Grove covers approximately 60 km², but the density of individuals is low. A critical finding is the state of the palm population: it consists primarily of mature, adult trees (4 to 8 m high), reflecting a senescent structure. The low density is attributed to the "morte paulatina dos butiás mais velhos" (gradual death of older palms) and, most importantly, the **"comprometimento da regeneração natural, exercido pelo gado"** (compromise of natural regeneration, exercised by cattle). The associated vegetation is dominated by the native grass *Elionurus sp.* in the herbaceous layer, alongside several other xeric and characteristic species, reinforcing the natural, edaphically-controlled status of the relict.</div>

This linkage confirms its importance as a crucial component of the region's native woody flora.<br><br>However, the study issues a strong warning regarding the palm grove’s survival. Due to the chronic failure of natural recruitment resulting from cattle grazing, the community is failing to replace older individuals. The authors definitively state that the vegetation is **"muito frágil e susceptível à extinção, se mantidas as atuais condições de uso na área"** (very fragile and susceptible to extinction, if the current land use conditions are maintained). Therefore, immediate changes in land management are necessary to ensure the conservation and resilience of this unique habitat.</div>

The authors confirm a much broader natural distribution of *P. affinis* than previously acknowledged, identifying relictual parks in various municipalities (Quaraí, São Vicente do Sul, Cacequi, Rosário do Sul, Alegrete) that contradict earlier literature limiting the species to a small area near Barra do Quaraí.<br><br>Phytogeographically, the Espinhal Province is represented by the Distrito do Inhanduvá in Western RS. This district is characterized by specific communities, including the *Nandubaysal*, defined by the co-occurrence of *P. affinis* and *Vachellia caven* (espinilho). The distribution of *P. affinis* is strongly linked to narrow sedimentary formations and alluvial deposits. The broad valley of the Ibicuí River is identified as the crucial migratory corridor that allowed the species to cross the basaltic Campanha Plateau, explaining the isolated occurrence of parks further east, interpreted as relictual fragments of a wider distribution during the late Pleistocene.<br><br>Ecologically, *P. affinis* is highly heliophilic. The expansion of taller riparian forest species (mata ciliar) during the Holocene's warmer, wetter climate led to increased shading, which compromised *P. affinis*'s permanence and caused the natural disappearance of many parks. This process of fragmentation was dramatically accelerated by human activity, particularly the introduction and expansion of rice cultivation (lavoura arrozeira), which led to the systematic destruction of these natural parks along the floodplains.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study establishes that the natural occurrence of *Prosopis affinis* in Rio Grande do Sul is far more extensive than cited in limiting literature, with isolated parks representing crucial relictual fragments of the Espinhal Province. The species' distribution is primarily dictated by its strict edaphic requirement for sedimentary formations, explaining the migratory route along the Ibicuí River valley.<br><br>The authors specifically refute claims that the distribution of *P. affinis* is restricted by a single soil type (Gleissolo Melânico) or geographically confined, noting the species' wide distribution across South America in varied soils. They also reject the historical hypothesis of human introduction by Jesuits, arguing that the species lacked sufficient cultural importance to warrant cultivation, implying its presence is natural.<br><br>Regarding the thesis subject, *Vachellia caven* (espinilho) is confirmed as a co-occurring species in the *Nandubaysal* association. However, the authors conclude that *V. caven* is an extremely widespread native species in RS, inhabiting diverse terrains, including shallow soils derived from volcanic basalt on the Campanha Plateau. Its broad natural presence extends far beyond the specialized edaphic boundaries of the Espinhal Province (Distrito do Inhanduvá), meaning that its solitary presence is insufficient to define the phytogeographic unit, thus supporting its status as a fundamental, widely distributed native component of the region.</div>

Em geral, atribuía-se aos fósseis uma origem sobrenatural, porém alguns gregos já lhes interpretavam como sendo relacionados a restos de organismos. Atualmente, o termo “fóssil” abrange todos restos e vestígios de organismos preservados nos sistemas naturais, seja em rochas, sedimentos, gelo ou âmbar. Esta compreensão moderna é mais eficaz, pois traduz a consolidação dos fundamentos da paleontologia e das ciências naturais no século XX. Porém, hoje em dia os desafios são maiores, pois a sociedade tem cobrado a aplicabilidade da pesquisa científica para o desenvolvimento humano e da própria sociedade. O Congresso Brasileiro de Paleontologia é um evento reconhecido em âmbito nacional e conquistou tradição nesta área do conhecimento. Em sua décima oitava edição, pela primeira vez na região centro-oeste, tem como objetivo registrar um marco na história da paleontologia brasileira com a participação de especialistas de renome internacional apresentando propostas técnico-científicas voltadas para áreas educacionais, empresariais e governamentais. Com este enfoque serão abordados diversos aspectos da Paleontologia, além de assuntos relacionados à geologia do petróleo, geologia ambiental, museologia e preservação do patrimônio geológico e paleontológico do Brasil. Além das sessões técnicas, os ciclos de conferências sobre PALEOECOLOGIA E PALEOAMBIENTE, BIOESTRATIGRAFIA APLICADA, PATRIMÔNIO FOSSILÍFERO, PALEOGEOGRAFIA DO NEÓGENO E QUATERNÁRIO e BIOTAS PRÉ-CAMBRIANAS, constituem um ponto de destaque deste evento. Serão também realizados simpósios em ENSINO DE CIÊNCIAS, EVOLUÇÃO BIOLÓGICA e, pela primeira vez neste congresso, o SIMPÓSIO DA AMPLA (Associação Latino-americana de Micropaleontologia). Para a realização deste evento, a UnB e a SBP receberam patrocínio de diversas instituições: Petróleo Brasileiro/SA – PETROBRAS, Patrocinador Máster, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – CAPES, Serviço Geológico do Brasil – CPRM, Universidade Católica de Goiás - UCG, Departamento Nacional da Produção Mineral – DNPM. Além destas instituições, contou-se com apoio da Associação Latino-americana de Micropaleontologia – AMPLA, e da Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia – SBG, em especial ao Núcleo de Brasília e à equipe de Computação Gráfica da UCG pela valiosa contribuição à programação visual do evento. Agradecemos também à Editora T. A. Queiroz, pela permissão de fotos do livro “Fósseis do Brasil”.

Vachellia caven is a thorny leguminous shrub to treelet, widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and spanning across the Southern Cone from Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina and Chile. Most of the contemporary research focuses on the western range of the species distribution, in Chile, though this review emphasizes the species' long-term and widespread ecological importance in the eastern range, particularly within the Pampas of Southern South America. The Pampas is one of the most threatened open vegetation ecosystems, rapidly losing native habitats due to intense conversion for agriculture and livestock production. Driven by historical land use practices and the vast areas designated for livestock, xeric and spiny vegetation has long been suppressed and actively removed, as part of pasture management strategies. This review challenges the prevailing narrative that portrays V. caven as a controversial or ambiguous species, frequently labeled as "invasive woody encroacher". This designation, often documented in regions severely affected by conversion and overgrazing, reflects a socio-economic bias that emphasizes its purported negative impact on forage production while overlooking its ecological significance. The observed woody encroachment is fundamentally perceived as a symptom of anthropogenic degradation, including the historical removal of woody vegetation and chronic overgrazing. In contrast to this exploitative view, this xeric species acts as a crucial pioneer and "nurse" plant, essential for ecological succession and for sustaining a unique assemblage of native plants and animals. It facilitates the recruitment of other woody and herbaceous species by improving microhabitat conditions, including nitrogen enrichment and enhanced soil properties. By reframing V. caven’s encroachment as an indicator of ecosystem degradation rather than species invasiveness, we challenge the prevalent narrative that supports active removal of V. caven while underestimating its natural distributional range. Recognizing this species as fundamental to Pampas’ resilience and recovery is therefore essential for effective conservation and the development of sustainable restoration strategies.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This review establishes a geographical critique, noting that current research heavily favors the western distribution of *Vachellia caven* (Chile), while the review focuses on the eastern range, specifically the threatened Pampas of Southern South America. The Pampas ecosystem is highlighted as suffering severe habitat loss due to agriculture and livestock conversion, where historical land use has actively suppressed and removed xeric vegetation like *V. caven* for pasture management.<br><br>The core of the analysis challenges the designation of *V. caven* as an "invasive woody encroacher." The authors argue that this label stems from a socio-economic bias focused primarily on maximizing forage production, thereby overlooking the species' substantial ecological role. Instead of being an invasive driver, the observed woody encroachment is reinterpreted as a direct consequence and symptom of anthropogenic degradation, specifically historical woody removal and chronic overgrazing.<br><br>The paper provides evidence of the species' positive ecological role, defining it as a crucial pioneer and "nurse" plant. This role involves improving microhabitat conditions—namely, through nitrogen enrichment and the enhancement of soil properties—which facilitates ecological succession and the successful recruitment of diverse native woody and herbaceous species.</div>

This shift in perspective is deemed essential not only for achieving effective conservation outcomes but also for developing appropriate and sustainable restoration strategies within this highly threatened open vegetation ecosystem.</div>

Its overarching goal is to standardize the concepts, terminology, and methodologies used for the analysis, characterization, classification, and mapping of Brazilian vegetation by the IBGE team, ensuring high-quality and consistent information dissemination.<br><br>This manual is organized into four major chapters detailing the methodological procedures:<br>1. **Phytogeographic System (Sistema fitogeográfico):** This section provides the theoretical foundation, reviewing universal and national classification systems and establishing the hierarchical scheme (e.g., Domínio, Formação, Sinúsia). It introduces the official classification legend, which is crucial for defining ecosystems relevant to the thesis, such as *Estepe (Campos do sul do Brasil)*, which corresponds to the Pampas, and its sub-types (*Estepe Arborizada, Estepe Parque, Estepe Gramíneo-Lenhosa*). It also defines specialized categories like the *Sistema da Vegetação Secundária (Tratos Antrópicos)*, recognizing areas subject to human impact such as *Pecuária* (livestock).<br><br>2. **Inventory of Forest and Grassland Formations (Inventário das formações florestais e campestres):** This chapter focuses on practical methods for field assessment, covering different inventory types (reconnaissance, semi-detailed), various sampling techniques (systematic, stratified), and crucial procedures for quantifying the potential of woody/arboreal resources (*potencial lenhoso/arbóreo*) specifically within non-forest formations like Savana (Cerrado) and Savana-Estépica (Caatinga). This detailed focus on quantifying woody elements in grasslands is essential context for understanding the 'woody encroachment' phenomenon.<br><br>3. **Techniques and Management of Botanical Collections (Técnicas e manejo de coleções botânicas):** This section outlines standardized procedures for field collection, preservation (herborization, pressing, drying), labeling, and identification of botanical samples, ensuring the proper acquisition and maintenance of data required for species-level confirmation.<br><br>4. **Procedures for Regional Vegetation Mapping (Procedimentos para mapeamento da vegetação em escala regional):** This final chapter describes the technical workflow for cartographic production, spanning from literature review and base map preparation to digital image processing (georeferencing, enhancement), field validation, integration of data into databases, and final map generation (typically at scales from 1:250,000 to 1:1,000,000).</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The primary conclusion of the manual, articulated in the presentation and introduction, is the imperative need for the uniform adoption of criteria and terminology within the Brazilian Vegetation Classification System. This standardization is deemed critical for researchers and mappers working at all levels of detail, from broad regional studies down to semi-detailed local surveys. The manual serves as the definitive reference to ensure methodological consistency across national studies of vegetation physiognomies.<br><br>The document explicitly validates and integrates the classification of human-altered areas into the system through the category *Sistema da Vegetação Secundária (Tratos Antrópicos)*, encompassing major land uses such as *Agricultura* and *Pecuária* (livestock). By officially including these anthropological treatments, the IBGE acknowledges the pervasive influence of human activities on the landscape structure, providing a framework against which ecological changes, such as woody proliferation, must be documented.<br><br>Furthermore, the manual stands as a continuation of established Brazilian phytogeography, paying homage to key figures like Henrique Pimenta Veloso, whose work laid the groundwork for the modern Brazilian Phytogeographic System in 1982. This continuity highlights the institutional commitment to rigorous, established scientific methods for monitoring and classifying the nation's diverse natural resources.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Premise: Accurate species delimitation is essential
for evolutionary biology,
conservation, and biodiversity management. We studied species delimitation in
North American pinyon pines, Pinus subsection Cembroides, a natural group with
high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Methods: We used coalescent‐based methods and multivariate analyses of low‐copy
number nuclear genes and nearly complete high‐copy number plastomes generated
with the Hyb‐Seq method. The three coalescent‐based species delimitation methods
evaluated were the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), Poisson Tree
Process (PTP), and Trinomial Distribution of Triplets (Tr2). We also measured
admixture in populations with possible introgression. Results: Our results show inconsistencies among GMYC, PTP, and Tr2. The single‐
locus based GMYC analysis of plastid DNA recovered a higher number of species
(up to 24 entities, including singleton lineages and clusters) than PTP and the multi‐
locus coalescent approach. The PTP analysis identiﬁed 10 species whereas Tr2
recovered 13, which agreed closely with taxonomic treatments. Conclusions: We found that PTP and GMYC identiﬁed species with low levels of
ILS and high morphological divergence (P. maximartinezii, P. pinceana, and
P. rzedowskii). However, GMYC method oversplit species by identiﬁcation of more
divergent samples as singletons. Moreover, both PTP and GMYC were incapable of
identifying some species that are readily identiﬁed morphologically. We suggest that
the divergence times between lineages within North American pinyon pines are so
disparate that GMYC results are unreliable. Results of the Tr2 method coincided well
with previous delimitations based on morphology, DNA, geography, and secondary
chemistry.</p>

The authors employed coalescent-based methods and used the Hyb-Seq sequencing approach to generate data from 207 low-copy nuclear genes and nearly complete plastomes. A total of 93 individuals were sampled, including 80 from the target subsection.<br><br>Three coalescent-based species delimitation methods were evaluated and compared: the single-locus Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), the Poisson Tree Process (PTP), and the multi-locus Trinomial Distribution of Triplets (Tr2). Data processing included stringent filtering of nuclear genes to exclude paralogs and sequences with low pairwise identity or anomalously high substitution rates. Phylogenetic analysis utilized Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes) on both concatenated nuclear genes and partitioned plastome sequences.<br><br>### Results<br><br>The three methods provided inconsistent results regarding species counts. The single-locus GMYC analysis, particularly when applied to plastid DNA, severely oversplit the taxa, recovering up to 24 distinct entities. In comparison, the PTP analysis identified 10 species, while the multi-locus Tr2 analysis recovered 13 species. <br><br>The Tr2 results were found to agree closely with established taxonomic treatments. PTP and GMYC were successful in identifying species characterized by low ILS and high morphological divergence (*P. maximartinezii*, *P. pinceana*, and *P. rzedowskii*). However, the GMYC method tended to oversplit taxa by identifying divergent samples as singletons.

They explicitly stated that the divergence times were so disparate that GMYC results were untrustworthy.<br><br>The study highlighted the superior performance of the multi-locus coalescent approach, Tr2, whose results coincided well with previous taxonomic delimitations established through the integration of multiple data streams, including morphology, DNA, geography, and secondary chemistry.

Tras algunas cervezas y sabrosas anécdotas, emergió una interesante discusión respecto a lo desagregada que se encontraba la información e investigación sobre restauración, así como la brecha que existía para que estudiantes, técnicos y profesionales interesados en restaurar, pudieran acceder a conocimientos teóricos y prácticos actualizados y en español. Gran parte del conocimiento se encontraba disperso en cientos de artículos en inglés, en revistas de acceso restringido o en libros difíciles de conseguir, y donde abundan los ejemplos de restauración propios de ecosistemas del hemisferio norte. Sin saber muy bien en lo que se iba a convertir este proyecto, nos preguntamos de forma muy ingenua: ¿Y si escribimos un libro de restauración de ecosistemas forestales para un público hispanohablante? La idea en simple era sintetizar el conocimiento existente, sistematizar en un solo libro la diversidad de tópicos que tratan de forma separada los libros de restauración, y no contentos con eso, presentar el contenido teórico-práctico de forma atractiva y lúdica para un estudiante, intentando innovar frente al tradicional formato de literatura técnica disponible en librerías chilenas. Quedamos muy entusiasmados/as con la idea, y pocas semanas después comenzó el trabajo, el cual ilusamente pensamos que tomaría, como mucho, dos años, ¡pero fueron 5 años!</p>

Com o objetivo estudar a história vegetacional desta formação e suas mudanças ao longo do Holoceno tardio, foi desenvolvida a pesquisa em um afloramento localizado na margem brasileira do rio Quaraí (30°16’27.9”S e 57°26’33.6”O), com a coleta de 86 amostras. Para determinação do espectro polínico atual, foram coletadas 15 amostras superficiais em diferentes ambientes do Parque do Espinilho (PESP). Um total de 81 táxons foi identificado nas amostras sedimentares do afloramento (10 férteis) e 114 nas amostras superficiais. Análises a partir dos diagramas polínicos foram realizadas apoiadas por datações radiocarbônicas e análises granulométricas. Os resultados indicam que entre 3.380 ± 25 e 2.350 ± 25 anos AP a área era composta por uma planície de inundação recoberta por gramíneas que formava corpos d’água de pequena profundidade, possibilitando o desenvolvimento de colônias de algas. Entre 2.328 e 2.262 anos AP observa-se diminuição da umidade e aumento de temperatura, evidenciado pelo desaparecimento das algas e maior frequência de briófitos. Entre 2.130 e 1.940 ± 20 anos AP é registrado aumento de umidade refletido na maior diversidade de táxons arbóreos, com expansão da Mata Ciliar. Os dados de granulometria corroboram com os dados palinológicos. O espectro polínico das amostras superficiais refletiu a composição taxonômica da flora do PESP, de acordo com a particularidade ecológica de cada ponto de amostragem. Este constitui o primeiro trabalho de palinologia desenvolvido na Savana Estépica Parque nos três países em que ocorre (Argentina Uruguai e Brasil). Os resultados aqui apresentados contribuirão para melhor compreensão da origem e desenvolvimento desta formação vegetacional, importante pelo endemismo de suas espécies e que está sob forte pressão antrópica por ocorrer em planícies de inundação, área de interesse para atividades agrícolas.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This technical guide focuses on the management of natural grasslands (pastizal natural) for livestock production, primarily in the context of the Uruguayan Pampas. The text first classifies grass species (Poaceas) based on their cycle (Perennial/Annual, Estival/Invernal) and habit (Estoloníferas, Rizomatosas, Cespitosas), emphasizing the agronomic relevance of classifying them as Fine, Tender, Ordinary, or Hard grasses.<br><br>Non-grass species are categorized, notably including "Malezas de campo sucio" (weeds of dirty field) such as Chircas, Carquejas, and Mío Mío—species described as having woody or spiny structures and low palatability except when young. Legumes are noted as being very scarce in these natural fields.<br><br>The core of the guide centers on three main management variables, ranked by importance: animal stocking rate (Carga o dotación animal), sheep/cattle ratio (Relación ovino/bovino), and grazing system (Sistema de pastoreo). Determining the appropriate "Capacidad de carga" (carrying capacity, detailed in a table by soil type, e.g., 0.50–0.55 UG/ha for Basalto superficial rojo) is presented as the most crucial management decision. The text explicitly defines overgrazing (sobrecarga) as maintaining animal numbers above carrying capacity, which breaks the equilibrium and degrades the pasture, irrespective of the grazing system used.<br><br>The guide outlines the severe symptoms of degradation resulting from chronic overgrazing: species reduction (loss of fine perennial winter grasses), a shift towards estival cycles, increased bare soil (promoting erosion and evaporation), and proliferation of aggressive annual grasses and malezas, such as Gramilla Brava (Cynodon dactylon). If degradation is severe, the ultimate management necessity is to completely destroy the natural field using total herbicides or tilling and transitioning to cultivated crops/green feed.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The primary conclusion is that achieving "producción sustentable" (sustainable production) in natural grasslands depends fundamentally on maintaining a stocking rate (carga) adjusted to the field's specific carrying capacity. Errors in determining the load cannot be compensated for by adjustments to grazing systems.<br><br>Overloading initiates a clear pathway of degradation, resulting in the loss of desirable perennial grass species and the subsequent ecological replacement by less productive annual grasses and weeds. The objective of management is to maintain the highest possible percentage of productive grass cover and high utilization rates, which often means suppressing species classified as 'malezas de campo sucio.'<br><br>While differential grazing systems (pastoreo diferido) can slightly increase forage production (10–20%) and manage composition by promoting erect grasses (cespitosas), they are not a viable solution for chronic overgrazing. High sheep/cattle ratios are discouraged as they tend to promote less manageable estival, erect species. The overall final conclusion emphasizes minimizing soil exposure and avoiding degradation to prevent the catastrophic necessity of eliminating the natural pasture entirely through aggressive means (herbicides and rotation). The entire framework reinforces a production-centric view where woody or spiny species are defined as undesirable obstacles ('malezas').</div>

Velasco et al. (2023) conclude that the only reasonable explanation for the presence of Vachellia [Acacia] caven in Chile (west of the Andes) is human transport during the Holocene, making it an invasive archeophyte. They present a poorly argued review which would have benefited from a better empirical grounding. A systematic review, rather than a traditional review, might have helped to get a broader overview of the literature. At the same time, the way in which the evidence was evaluated is also problematic. We believe that the question of Vachellia [Acacia] caven’s origins remains entirely unresolved.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This correspondence critically analyzes and refutes the arguments made by Velasco et al. (2023) classifying *Vachellia caven* in Chile as an invasive archeophyte, asserting that the question of its origin remains unresolved.<br><br>First, the authors challenge the evidentiary basis. They argue that the lack of fossil pollen evidence for *V. caven* west of the Andes is meaningless, as pollen fossilization is rare and evidence is similarly lacking east of the Andes. They also critique the precision of speciation estimates used to rule out natural dispersal before the Andes reached their maximum height.<br><br>Second, the core of the critique focuses on dispersal mechanisms. The authors argue that applying criteria of 'probability' or 'parsimony' to long-distance dispersal (LDD) is irrelevant, as LDD is inherently improbable and often trait-neutral over long time periods, yet numerous species have crossed the Andes. They dismiss the requirement that a disperser must cover 165 km in a single digestive event as an 'irrelevant and inaccurate criterion.' Instead, they propose a plausible low-frequency, non-human mechanism: endozoochory by large herbivores (like guanacos or extinct megafauna) through Andean passes, followed by hydrochory (washout) via rivers into central Chile.<br><br>Third, the paper reinforces the historical and ecological context. Extinct megafauna (e.g., Notiomastodon, giant ground sloths, extinct camelids) had high-Andean distributions and could have served as trans-Andean dispersers during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, they highlight that *V. caven* is a crucial pioneer species establishing post-disturbance, facilitated by livestock endozoochory, which acts as a proxy for megafauna. Crucially, they emphasize that *V. caven* 'dominates an early-succession formation and facilitates forest trees which later overshade it,' directly contradicting any purely negative view of its establishment.</div>

They assert that dismissing non-human dispersal mechanisms demonstrates a lack of knowledge and imagination regarding the species and the mechanisms involved.<br><br>Ultimately, they argue that **all scenarios for the origin of *Vachellia caven* remain plausible**, including natural vicariance or trans-Andean spread, potentially involving multiple dispersal events and mechanisms (including human transport). There is insufficient evidence to justify recategorizing the species as an invasive archeophyte.<br><br>Finally, the authors issue a strong conservation warning: recategorization as invasive poses a significant risk of 'exposing the species to lowered conservation protections.' They state that arguments allowing land conversion based on an 'invasive' label would be welcomed by developers and would undermine the natural successional process toward native forest that *V. caven* facilitates.</div>

EFEITOS DO PASTOREIO SOBRE A VEGETAÇÃO NATURAL EM FRAGMENTO
DE SAVANA ESTÉPICA PARQUE, RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRASIL

AUTORA: CRISTINA GOUVÊA REDIN
ORIENTADOR: SOLON JONAS LONGHI
Data e Local da Defesa: Santa Maria, 27 de fevereiro de 2013.

Apesar de ocupar lugar de destaque na flora sulina, a região pertencente ao Parque Estadual
do Espinilho, inserido dentro dos domínios fitogeográficos da Savana Estépica Parque, ainda
é pouco investigada pela ciência. Características da vegetação, tais como denso estrato
herbáceo e a presença de árvores isoladas, configuram-na como propícia à atividade
pecuarista. Valendo-se desse fato, o presente estudo objetivou analisar alterações florísticas e
edáficas, impostas pelo pastoreio. Para tanto, foram selecionadas duas área de estudo, uma
sob pastoreio e outra excluída dessa atividade a cinco anos, ambas contendo uma unidade
amostral de 2 ha, subdividida em 200 subunidades amostrais de 100 m². Foi realizado
inventário do estrato arbóreo e regenerante em 100 dessas subunidades amostrais e coleta de
dados das demais variáveis em 50 subunidades. A dissertação foi dividida em dois capítulos
com objetivos específicos de analisar a similaridade, alterações estruturais e florísticas na
vegetação arbórea e regenerante (Capítulo I), avaliar alterações em propriedades físicas do
solo e biomassa aérea total do estrato herbáceo entre as áreas, bem como investigar possíveis
correlações entre essas variáveis e a abundância das principais espécies presentes na
regeneração (Prosopis affinis Spreng. e Vachellia caven (Molina) Seigler & Ebinger)
(Capítulo II). Por meio de estudos referentes a atributos fitossociológicos e estruturais, pode-
se perceber notáveis diferenças entre as áreas, principalmente quanto à estrutura diamétrica da
vegetação e composição florística da regeneração natural, sendo Vachellia caven a espécie
melhor adaptada ao pastejo, ao contrário de Prosopis affinis. O resultado para similaridade
entre as áreas, conforme expresso pelo índice de Jaccard, é de média similaridade (75%). Em
relação às variáveis físicas do solo e biomassa aérea total do estrato herbáceo constataram-se
diferenças significativas entre áreas, evidenciadas por meio de testes-T de Student. Os testes
de correlação, realizados pelo método de Spearman, mostram que Vachellia caven
correlaciona-se positivamente com condições de solo conferidas à área com pastoreio e
negativamente com a biomassa aérea total do estrato herbáceo, o que comprova sua melhor
adaptação ao pastoreio e intolerância aos maiores níveis de sombreamento do solo. É possível
ainda inferir mediante análises exploratórias de ordenação (PCoA) que há uma total distinção
entre as duas áreas de estudo, configurada pelas notáveis alterações ocorrentes ao longo de
apenas cinco anos de exclusão nos componentes físicos do solo, estrato herbáceo e
abundância de Prosopis affinis e Vachellia caven.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study was conducted in a fragment of Savana Estépica Parque (Parque Estadual do Espinilho, RS, Brazil), an area suitable for livestock activity due to its dense herbaceous stratum and isolated trees. The primary objective was to analyze floristic and edaphic alterations imposed by grazing.<br><br>Two distinct study areas were selected: one currently under grazing (A1) and one where grazing had been excluded for five years (A2). Both areas comprised a 2 ha sample unit, subdivided into 200 subunites of 100 m². Inventories of the arboreal and regenerating strata were carried out in 100 subunites, and other variables (soil physics, herbaceous biomass) were collected in 50 subunites. The analysis was split into two chapters: Chapter I focused on similarity, structural, and floristic changes; Chapter II evaluated physical soil properties, total aerial herbaceous biomass, and investigated correlations with the abundance of the two main regeneration species: *Prosopis affinis* and *Vachellia caven*.<br><br>Key findings revealed notable differences between the areas in terms of vegetation diameter structure and natural regeneration composition. The similarity between the areas, calculated using the Jaccard index, was moderate (75%). Significant differences between A1 and A2 were found in physical soil variables and total aerial herbaceous biomass, evidenced by Student’s T-tests. The Spearman correlation tests demonstrated a critical distinction between the two studied species: *Vachellia caven* was found to be the species better adapted to grazing, unlike *Prosopis affinis*. Specifically, *V. caven* correlated positively with the harsh soil conditions typical of the grazed area and negatively with the total aerial herbaceous biomass, suggesting intolerance to higher levels of soil shading.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study concludes that the removal of grazing activity, even over a short period of five years, results in profound and measurable alterations in the Steppe Savanna Park ecosystem. There is a marked distinction between the grazed (A1) and protected (A2) areas, as confirmed by exploratory ordination analyses (PCoA), which captured changes in soil physical components, the herbaceous stratum, and the relative abundance of key species (*P. affinis* and *V. caven*).<br><br>The results highlight the superior adaptation of *Vachellia caven* to disturbances associated with livestock, including potentially compacted soil conditions and reduced herbaceous cover (less shading). Conversely, *Prosopis affinis* demonstrates sensitivity to grazing pressure. This differential adaptation directly influences the floristic composition and structural attributes of the natural regeneration layer. Ultimately, the research confirms that grazing is a dominant driver shaping the structure and composition of the natural vegetation and soil environment in this fragment of Savana Estépica Parque.</div>

The authors emphasize that existing scientific knowledge regarding the constituent species of this silvatic-campestre vegetation was insufficient, contributing to errors in official documents and hindering conservation efforts aimed at protecting the vegetation from extinction.<br><br>The main result was the confirmation and detailed description of two species: *Prosopis algarobilla* Gris. (Inhanduvã) and *Prosopis nigra* (Gris.) Hieron. (Algarrobo). Historically, only *P. algarobilla* was widely cited in the botanical literature of RS. The identification of *P. nigra* confirmed its status as native to the region, officially adding it to the flora of Rio Grande do Sul.<br><br>The authors provided differentiating morphological details. *P. algarobilla* typically exhibits a wide, flattened canopy, leaves with 1-4 cm long pinnas, and inflorescences larger than the leaves. It is described as having a broader distribution along the Ibicui River basin. In contrast, *P. nigra* tends toward an umbel-shaped canopy, has very short petioles (up to 2 cm), and inflorescences that are shorter than the leaves. Crucially for conservation, while *P. algarobilla* is typical of the Espinilho Park, *P. nigra* was found to be highly restricted in RS, observed only in the Espinilho Park near Barra do Quaraí, suggesting a localized presence and potential vulnerability. Both species provide durable wood, charcoal, and their fruits are noted as an important natural food source for livestock ("gado de pastoreio").</div>

For all trees and regeneration, measurements included circumference at breast height (CBH), total height, trunk height, and the radius of crown projection across four cardinal points. The calculated structural parameters included Abundance, Dominance, Frequency, and the Index of Importance Value (IVI) for each species across height and diameter classes. Natural regeneration included all individuals with a CBH less than 5 cm. The fisionomic description was supplemented by two diagrammatic profiles (vertical and horizontal projection) and photographs.<br><br>**Results:** The vegetation structure is primarily defined by five arboreal species: *Prosopis nigra* (inhanduvã), *Prosopis affinis* (algarrobo), *Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco* (quebracho), *Parkinsonia aculeata* (cina-cina), and *Acacia caven* (espinilho). The quebracho and cina-cina form an emergent stratum above the paucifoliate layer, which includes the *Prosopis* species and espinilho. The overall canopy is characterized by interpenetration but leaves significant open spaces. This structure facilitates the development of a dense herbaceous and grassy stratum, including species from genera like *Andropogon*, *Paspalum*, *Setaria*, and *Stipa*, as well as Compositae, Leguminosae, and Oxalidaceae. The association exhibits a xerophytic character (e.g., presence of *Opuntia bonaerensis* and thick, cracked bark). Furthermore, the area contains small circular 'islands' of larger trees and riparian species (*Scutia buxifolia*, *Guettarda uruguensis*), indicating influence from the adjacent ciliary forest.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The analysis successfully detailed the phytosociological structure of the Parque Inhanduvã association, confirming it as a unique and specific type of natural park formation within Brazil, related to the broader Mesopotamian Park formations. The dominant arboreal species, including *Acacia caven* (espinilho), are fundamental structural components defining the canopy stratification and contributing to the overall xerophytic morphology. <br><br>The primary finding leading to the conclusion is that this association is considered **"a rare association in Brazil"** and constitutes a **"very fragile ecosystem"**, occupying a highly restricted area in the extreme southwest of Rio Grande do Sul. Due to its scarcity and ecological vulnerability, the authors strongly recommend the preservation of this specific formation. This highlights the natural, structural importance of *Acacia caven* within this unique, threatened environment, supporting the argument that it is a key native component requiring conservation, not removal.</div>

Between 1990 and 2000, 285,000 hectares were deforested annually, leading to projections of total extinction of native forests by 2025-2028. Specifically in Entre Ríos province, native woodlands (*montes nativos*) have decreased dramatically, from 2.5 million hectares to less than 500,000 hectares, or approximately 33% of the land surface according to some estimates.<br><br>In the Centro-Norte region of Entre Ríos, the remaining *montes* show significant deterioration. The authors explicitly identify the primary causes as *manejo tradicional de la ganadería* (traditional livestock management), which alters the forest's structure and composition, and unplanned agriculture. The specific impacts of traditional grazing include intensive pasturing, trampling (*pisoteo*), deficient drainage, and *enmalezamiento* (proliferation of weeds/bush), leading to deterioration across an estimated 800,000 hectares in the region.<br><br>### Proposed Solution: Agroforestry and Silvopastoral Systems<br><br>Given the limitations of the region’s soils for intensive traditional agriculture, the manual proposes the adoption of Silvopastoral systems (a form of Agroforestería) as a sustainable alternative. Agroforestería is presented as an interdisciplinary approach that integrates woody species with agricultural crops and/or livestock. The rationality of this technology is to optimize positive interactions between components and the physical environment, increasing total productivity, diversification, and profitability while protecting the soil resource.<br><br>The document stresses that replacing forests with monocultures (agriculture or pastures) truncates the regenerative cycle, causing soil nutrients to deplete rapidly and forcing further expansion into forest land. In contrast, integrating trees maintains ecosystem stability, prevents erosion and desertification, and supports the combined production of timber and forage, offering a path for the recovery and sustainable management of the native woodland resource. This work is based on prior research into silvopastoral management models conducted since 1996 in the region.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The core conclusion of the introductory sections is that the severe degradation of the native woodlands in Entre Ríos—characterized by massive historical deforestation, loss of productive capacity, and structural deterioration—is fundamentally a result of unsustainable, traditional agricultural and livestock management practices, particularly chronic overgrazing and unplanned deforestation.<br><br>This degradation results in negative ecological outcomes, including high risks of water erosion due to low soil stability and the consequent reduction in productive capacity. The authors stress that without proper planning and a shift away from traditional exploitation, the ecosystem will continue its decline.<br><br>Consequently, the manual’s central recommendation is to transition toward sustainable **silvopastoral ecosystems (Agroforestería)**. This approach is viewed as crucial because it offers an alternative productive vision that is non-contaminating and non-degrading. By consciously integrating trees, crops, and animals, the land use can maximize resource utilization, preserve biodiversity, maintain nutrient cycles, and protect soil stability, thereby ensuring the long-term persistence and productivity of the Espinal ecosystem, where species like Ñandubay (a key woody species) predominate.</div>

The goal of this study was evaluated the effect of cattle and rabbit exclusion and the Acacia caven on natural regeneration of woody species, in a seven-year experiment in two localities (Pirque and Peñuelas) of central Chile. Six exclosures and  control  areas  were  established  in  degraded  savannas  of  A.  caven  close  to sclerophyllous forest fragments, where sexual and asexual (resprouts) regeneration was sampled  in  plots  located  under the  canopy  of  A.  caven  and  in  open  sites.  After  seven years, species richness and abundance of plants of sexual regeneration (size 0.5-2m) was significantly greater within exclosures than in control areas. Species richness and abundance of both type of regeneration was greater Under A. caven than in open sites in  both  localities.  In  Peñuelas,  abundance  of  asexually  regenerated  seedlings  was significantly  greater  within  exclosures  than  in  control  areas,  in  both  localities.  In  no variable  or  locality  some  significant  effect  of  the  interaction  between  A.  caven  and exclosure was detected. Our results suggest that when cattle and rabbits are present, the use of exclosures may allow colonization of open sites and successional advance under canopy of Acacia caven. Instead, asexual regeneration does not seem to be importantly affected by herbivores, and hence it may contribute to recover this forest when exclusion of large surfaces is not possible.</p>

Regeneration was sampled in plots located either under the canopy of *A. caven* (nurse effect) or in open sites, allowing for the analysis of four treatment combinations. The data collected between 2012 and 2017 included both sexual regeneration (from seed germination) and asexual regeneration (resprouts).<br><br>Key results demonstrated strong positive effects from both exclusion and facilitation. After seven years, species richness and abundance of sexually regenerated plants (specifically those 0.5–2m in height) were significantly greater inside the exclosures than in control areas. Supporting the nurse plant hypothesis, species richness and abundance of both sexual and asexual regeneration types were consistently greater under the canopy of *A. caven* compared to open sites in both study locations. Although sexual regeneration benefited markedly from exclusion, in Peñuelas, asexual regeneration abundance was also significantly greater within exclosures. Crucially, the researchers did not detect a significant interaction effect between the presence of *A. caven* and herbivore exclusion, suggesting these two positive restoration drivers acted largely independently.</div>

We address this question for South and Central America (Neotropical biogeographic realm) by compiling data on plant defence traits, cli-mate, soil, and ﬁre, as well as on the historical distribution of extinct megafauna and extant mammal herbivores. We show that historical mammal herbivory, especially by extinct megafauna, and soil fertility explain substantial variability in wood density, leaf size, spines and latex. We also identiﬁed three distinct regions (‘‘antiherbiomes’’), differing in plant defences, environmental conditions, and megafauna history. These patterns largely matched those observed in African ecosystems, where abundant megafauna still roams, and suggest that some ecoregions experienced savanna-to-forest shifts following megafauna extinctions. Here, we show that extinct megafauna left a signiﬁcant imprint on current ecosystem biogeography.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The study analyzed the influence of extinct Neotropical megafauna (130,000 to 1500 CE) on current plant functional traits and biome geography across South and Central America. The authors compiled ecoregion-level data for five antiherbivory defense traits in woody species: wood density, leaf size, spinescence (leaf and stem), and latex production. These traits were correlated with megafauna metrics (richness, body mass, and diet type—grazer, browser, mixed feeder), extant herbivore data, and environmental variables (climate, soil, fire).<br><br>Results indicated that megafauna history, particularly richness and the ratio of grazers to browsers, explained substantial variability in antiherbivory traits. Specifically, wood density and leaf spines increased, while leaf size decreased, with higher megafauna richness. The occurrence of mega-grazers relative to browsers was a key driver for investment in dense wood and spines. Stem spines were best explained by mid-size megafauna body mass and high soil pH (alkaline soils).<br><br>The researchers used PCA to define three "antiherbiomes" based on convergent defense strategies: (1) Small Leaves Thorny (SLT), characterized by high defenses (thorns, small leaves, wood density), arid/cold conditions, nutrient-rich soils, and a high density of extinct large grazers; (2) Broad Chemically-defended Leaves (BCL), featuring large, chemically defended leaves, moist climates, and few, large mega-browsers; and (3) Intermediate Leaves Woody (ILW), defined by very high wood density, intermediate traits, moist/hot climates, and nutrient-poor soils. The study identified 27 forest-dominated ecoregions (covering 6.4 million Km²) that were likely grassy ecosystems during the Pleistocene, based on their high richness of megafauna grazers and classification into the SLT or ILW antiherbiomes. This confirms massive savanna-to-forest biome shifts post-extinction.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the long-term impact of extinct Neotropical megafauna is profoundly reflected in current patterns of plant defense trait geography and ecosystem distribution. This supports the hypothesis that large mammal herbivores are essential drivers of ecosystem structure, and their historical absence resulted in lasting ecological shifts, often seen as *anachronical* defense traits persisting in modern flora.<br><br>The research established that South-Central America and Africa shared similar ecological pressures mediated by megafauna and soil fertility, leading to the formation of recognizable antiherbiomes across both continents. Crucially, the identification of the high-defense SLT and ILW antiherbiomes in areas now dominated by forest provides strong evidence for extensive savanna-to-forest biome shifts following the late Pleistocene megafauna extinction. These findings suggest that the functional structure of many Neotropical ecosystems today is primarily a relic of past intense herbivory pressure, providing critical insights for understanding recent dynamics and shifts in Neotropical biomes.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Vachellia caven is a thorny leguminous shrub to treelet, widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and spanning across the Southern Cone from Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina and Chile. Most of the contemporary research focuses on the western range of the species distribution, in Chile, though this review emphasizes the species' long-term and widespread ecological importance in the eastern range, particularly within the Pampas of Southern South America. The Pampas is one of the most threatened open vegetation ecosystems, rapidly losing native habitats due to intense conversion for agriculture and livestock production. Driven by historical land use practices and the vast areas designated for livestock, xeric and spiny vegetation has long been suppressed and actively removed, as part of pasture management strategies. This review challenges the prevailing narrative that portrays V. caven as a controversial or ambiguous species, frequently labeled as "invasive woody encroacher". This designation, often documented in regions severely affected by conversion and overgrazing, reflects a socio-economic bias that emphasizes its purported negative impact on forage production while overlooking its ecological significance. The observed woody encroachment is fundamentally perceived as a symptom of anthropogenic degradation, including the historical removal of woody vegetation and chronic overgrazing. In contrast to this exploitative view, this xeric species acts as a crucial pioneer and "nurse" plant, essential for ecological succession and for sustaining a unique assemblage of native plants and animals. It facilitates the recruitment of other woody and herbaceous species by improving microhabitat conditions, including nitrogen enrichment and enhanced soil properties. By reframing V. caven’s encroachment as an indicator of ecosystem degradation rather than species invasiveness, we challenge the prevalent narrative that supports active removal of V. caven while underestimating its natural distributional range. Recognizing this species as fundamental to Pampas’ resilience and recovery is therefore essential for effective conservation and the development of sustainable restoration strategies.</p>

Unlike standard primary research, this text summarizes findings from a review process, focusing on synthesizing existing literature to challenge prevailing management paradigms.<br><br>### Findings and Reinterpretations<br><br>1.  **Geographical Shift:** The review intentionally shifts focus from the heavily studied western range of *V. caven* (Chile) to its long-term ecological importance in the eastern range, specifically the Pampas, an ecosystem critically threatened by conversion to agriculture and intensive livestock production.<br>2.  **Socio-economic Bias Critique:** The research identifies that the widespread classification of *V. caven* as an "invasive woody encroacher" stems from historical land use practices and a socio-economic bias rooted in pasture management strategies. This bias prioritizes forage production, leading to the historical suppression and active removal of xeric and spiny vegetation.<br>3.  **Reframing Encroachment:** The central finding is that observed woody encroachment should not be interpreted as species invasiveness, but rather as a *symptom* of anthropogenic degradation. This degradation includes chronic overgrazing and the historical suppression and removal of native woody vegetation.<br>4.  **Positive Ecological Role:** In direct contrast to the negative portrayal, the review highlights the vital ecological function of the species. *V. caven* acts as a "crucial pioneer and 'nurse' plant," essential for ecological succession. It facilitates the recruitment of native plants and animals by improving microhabitat conditions, notably through nitrogen enrichment and general enhancement of soil properties.</div>

The motivation stems from the recognition that *espinillo* is a native forest component and a primary colonizer that often signals the native forest's attempt to reclaim space after disturbance. However, dense colonization (affecting approximately 30,000 hectares of INC land) presents a challenge, leading to contrasting management behaviors—some producers seek total elimination, while others seek integration.<br><br>In response to this conflict, institutional partners (INC, INIA, MGAP divisions, Udelar, etc.) collaborated to promote integrated systems where *espinillo* acts in synergy with pastures and livestock. The main methodological axis was a field day in May 2023, where 130 participants visited three successful management cases. <br><br>Case A (Pablo Gauthier, dairy) implemented management by maintaining tree rows (9 to 16 meters apart) to promote apical dominance, controlling inter-row regrowth with three annual passes of a rotative cutter, combined with strategic pasture resting. Case B (José Heit, mixed system) practiced controlled thinning (raleos) and pruning within typical park forest areas (espinillo and algarrobo) to balance tree cover, herbaceous growth, and controlled firewood extraction. Case C (Grupo Los Costeros, ranching) focused on restoring agricultural degraded land by combining varied tree densities with native pasture promotion, including experimental sowing of *Paspalum notatum - INIA Sepé* (a pioneer graminea), using adequate pasture rest periods to encourage competition against regrowth. The collaboration concluded by producing a specific publication and a guidance booklet (cartilla).</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">El impacto humano sobre los ecosistemas ha alcanzado dimensiones tan grandes que es considerado uno de los factores principales del cambio global. En particular, los cambios en el uso del suelo son el principal agente de cambio debido a sus efectos sobre los ciclos biogeoquímicos, el clima y la biodiversidad. América Latina en general, y los Pastizales del Rio de la Plata (PRP) en particular, son una de las regiones del mundo con mayores tasas de cambio en el uso/cobertura del suelo en los últimos tiempos. A pesar de la magnitud de este proceso de cambio, las descripciones de uso/cobertura del suelo en los PRP distan mucho de ser completas, más aun aquellas que evalúan su cambio a través del tiempo. Para evaluar el impacto de dichos cambios es imprescindible describirlos con precisión. El objetivo de esta tesis es describir el uso/cobertura del suelo en Uruguay y los PRP, analizar sus cambios a lo largo del tiempo y evaluar el impacto de estos cambios sobre el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas en términos de las ganancias de carbono y su apropiación por los humanos. En primer lugar se desarrollaron metodologías para clasificar el uso/cobertura del suelo sobre grandes extensiones de territorio a partir de su fenología, utilizando extensas bases de datos de campo y series temporales de imágenes de satélite, generando un mapa de uso/cobertura del suelo para todo el territorio uruguayo. En segundo lugar, mediante un experimento manipulativo y el uso de sensores hiperespectrales, se desarrollaron modelos para discriminar y cuantificar densidades variables de arbustos en una matriz de pastizales naturales, un insumo fundamental para lograr cartografiar una categoría particularmente compleja que permitirá explorar la arbustización en pastizales, un proceso de gran interés ecológico, debido a sus impactos y a lo incierto de sus causas. En tercer lugar, se utilizan las técnicas desarrolladas para cartografiar el uso/cobertura del suelo sobre grandes superficies, para analizar el uso/cobertura del suelo en los PRP y sus cambios a lo largo del tiempo, en un momento en que la región está sometida a un fuerte proceso de intensificación de la producción agrícola. Finalmente se evalúa el impacto de dichos cambios sobre la Productividad Primaria Neta (PPN), uno de los atributos del funcionamiento ecosistémico más importantes e integradores, a través del cálculo de la Apropiación Humana de la PPN (AHPPN), un indicador muy completo del impacto antrópico sobre los ecosistemas. Los cálculos fueron realizados a partir de partir de los mapas generados y estimaciones de la PPN realizadas con estadísticas agropecuarias a nivel subnacional y modelación de datos de imágenes de satélite.

La aproximación desarrollada permitió describir el uso/cobertura del suelo en Uruguay y los PRP, generalmente con altos niveles de exactitud, con resolución temporal anual y analizar sus cambios a lo largo del tiempo. Los PRP están inmersos en un fuerte proceso de cambios en el uso del suelo asociados a la intensificación de la producción agropecuaria y a expensas de pérdida de áreas de pastizales. La mayor expansión agrícola en el período estudiado se concentra en ambas márgenes de Rio Uruguay, en la Pampa Mesopotámica y en la porción oeste de Campos del Norte y del Sur, y en la porción oeste de la Pampa Interior. Esta nueva ola de agriculturización y el continuo avance del proceso de intensificación agrícola en los polos tradicionales han llevado a la casi total transformación de gran parte del área de estudio.

Los modelos generados para cuantificar la densidad de arbustos permiten explicar porcentajes muy importantes de la varianza y poseen, en muchos casos, un poder predictivo razonablemente bueno. Sus resultados constituyen uno de los primeros antecedentes en la cuantificación de la cantidad de arbustos en la porción más húmeda del gradiente de precipitación en pastizales, donde ambos componentes del tapiz, el herbáceo y el arbustivo, son fotosintéticamente activos durante todo el año. La simulación de los modelos generados a partir de la información que recaban los sensores a bordo de satélites muestra el potencial para la generación de mapas que den cuenta de la densidad de arbustos.

Mediante la cuantificación y la cartografía de los cambios producidos por los humanos en la PPN y su flujo en los ecosistemas, el concepto de AHPPN provee una estimación cuantificable de la intensidad del uso del suelo, a una escala y con un nivel de detalle nunca antes realizado. Los resultados muestran que el impacto humano sobre el flujo de energía en los ecosistemas de los PRP alcanza niveles muy altos en comparación con otras regiones del mundo, apropiándonos de más del 40% de la PPN de la vegetación potencial. Este impacto ocurre además a tasas crecientes debido al intenso proceso de cambio en el uso del suelo y está mayoritariamente concentrado en los grandes polos agrícolas de la región, donde la AHPPN es prácticamente total.</p>

This 'new wave of agriculturalization' has led to the near-total modification of large study areas, affirming the urgent need for precise monitoring and analysis of land use changes.<br><br>Regarding the technical advances, the methods developed for quantifying shrub density are highly robust and represent a significant early achievement in mapping woody vegetation in humid grassland environments where both herbaceous and woody components are photosynthetically active. The success of the simulation using satellite sensor data validates the potential for generating broad, detailed maps of shrub density, which is crucial for understanding the complex process of arbustización.<br><br>Most critically, the evaluation of human impact confirmed that the anthropogenic pressure on PRP ecosystems is among the highest globally. The Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (AHPPN) exceeds 40% of the potential NPP. This high level, which is rapidly increasing due to LUCC, indicates that human activity severely dictates the energy flow within the ecosystems. The impact is concentrated in agricultural centers, where AHPPN is 'practically total,' highlighting the extreme intensity of land use in these areas.

In this sense we aimed to answer the following questions: i) Do the a priori defined phytophysionomies have a different species composition compared to the ecoregion? ii) Which environmental variables are related to species composition variation? iii) Which species are indicators of different phytophysiognomies? iv) Which native species are key for AFS implementation in these phytophysiognomies? We analysed floristic and environmental data from 106 sites across five phytophysiognomies using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) and Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) and the Indicator Species Analysis (IndVal). Results revealed significant differences in species composition between the phytophysiognomies, indicating that the predefined formations have distinct species assemblages.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Vachellia caven has a disjunct distribution at the southern cone of South America, occupying two major ranges: west of Andes (Central Chile) and east of them (mainly the South American Gran Chaco). For decades, the species has been subject to various ecological and natural history studies across its distribution, but questions concerning its origin in the western range remain unresolved. Thus far, it is unclear whether Vachellia caven was always a natural component of the Chilean forests, and "how" and "when" the species arrived in the country. In this study, we revised the dispersal syndromes of the species and contrast the two main hypotheses of dispersion to the west of Andes that have been proposed in the 90’s, namely animal versus human-mediated dispersal. For this, we reviewed all scientific literature on the species and explored the available information on morphology, genetics, fossil records and distribution patterns of closely related species. Here we illustrate how the collected evidence provides support for the human-mediated dispersal hypothesis, by including a conceptual synthesis that summarizes the outcomes of different dispersal scenarios. Lastly, and regarding the positive ecological effects this species has in the introduced area, we suggest reconsidering the (underappreciated) historical impacts of archaeophytes and rethinking the role that indigenous human tribes may have had in the dispersion of different plants in South America.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This study conducts a review to determine the origin of *Vachellia caven* in its western distribution (Central Chile), resolving whether its disjunct distribution is explained by vicariance or long-distance dispersal (LDD), and which agent—animal or human—mediated the dispersal.<br><br>The methodological approach involved a scoped review of 133 sources, including research articles, reviews, and grey literature, focusing on literature related to the species' history, varietal patterns, and dispersal mechanisms (hydrochory and endozoochory). Key topics reviewed included phylogeny and fossil records, morphological varieties, and trans-Andean dispersal hypotheses (the guanaco/animal hypothesis versus the human-mediated hypothesis).<br><br>Results overwhelmingly supported the LDD hypothesis over vicariance. Phylogeny suggests *V. caven*'s clade diversified after the major uplift of the Andes. Crucially, palynological and fossil records show continuous presence of related Fabaceae species east of the Andes since the Holocene, but a complete absence of natural records for *V. caven* west of the Andes outside of anthropogenic settlement sites. Furthermore, while six morphological varieties exist in the eastern range, only one (*A. caven* var. *caven*) is found in the western range, consistent with a single introduction event rather than deep historical presence.<br><br>Regarding dispersal mechanisms, the review found hydrochory (water dispersal) implausible for many western localities where the species establishes on hill slopes. Endozoochory, while relevant today via introduced cattle, lacked strong support for crossing the Andes by native megafauna (like the guanaco). Consequently, the gathered evidence robustly supports the human-mediated dispersal hypothesis, suggesting indigenous tribes transported the species across the mountains, thereby classifying it as an archaeophyte in Chile.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that the presence of *Vachellia caven* in Central Chile is best explained by long-distance dispersal mediated by indigenous humans, confirming the species' status as an archaeophyte in its western range. This means the species was introduced thousands of years ago, predating European contact, and is not a naturally dispersed native nor a recent invader.<br><br>Based on this revised historical status, the authors argue for a fundamental shift in perception. They emphasize that *V. caven* provides "positive ecological effects" in the introduced area. Therefore, the final conceptual conclusion suggests that society should actively reconsider the ecological significance and historical impacts of archaeophytes, many of which have become integral to the local ecosystem structure. They propose rethinking the critical role that indigenous human populations played in shaping the distribution and composition of South American plant life.</div>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a broadly used tool in different fields of plant ecology. Despite the importance of edaphic conditions in determining the niche of terrestrial plant species, edaphic data have rarely been included in ENMs of plant species perhaps because such data are not available for many regions. Recently, edaphic data has been made available at a global scale allowing its potential inclusion and evaluation on ENM performance for plant species. Here, we take advantage of such data and address the following main questions: What is the influence of distinct predictor variables (e.g. climatic vs edaphic) on different ENM algorithms? and what is the relationship between the performance of different predictors and geographic characteristics of species? We used 125 plant species distributed over the Neotropical region to explore the effect on ENMs of using edaphic data available from the SoilGrids database and its combination with climatic data from the CHELSA database. In addition, we related these different predictor variables to geographic characteristics of the target species and different ENM algorithms. The use of different predictors (climatic, edaphic, and both) significantly affected model performance and spatial complexity of the predictions. We showed that the use of global edaphic plus climatic variables generates ENMs with similar or better accuracy compared to those constructed only with climate variables. Moreover, the performance of models considering these different predictors, separately or jointly, was related to geographic properties of species records, such as number and distribution range. The large geographic extent, the variability of environments and the different species’ geographical characteristics considered here allowed us to demonstrate that global edaphic data adds useful information for plant ENMs. This is particularly valuable for studies of species that are distributed in regions where more detailed information on soil properties is poor or does not even exist.</p>

The climatic data consisted of 19 bioclimatic variables from CHELSA, and the edaphic data comprised 56 physical and chemical soil properties from the SoilGrids database. To address high collinearity among predictor variables, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used; the resulting PC scores explaining over 95% of the total variance were used as predictors (6 PCs for C and E models, 11 PCs for CE models).<br><br>The results demonstrated that the choice of predictor set (climatic, edaphic, or both) significantly influenced both model performance and the spatial complexity of the resulting predictions. Crucially, the authors found that combining global edaphic variables with climatic variables (CE.models) resulted in ENMs with accuracy similar to or superior to those constructed solely using climatic variables.

An evaluation that combined both factors can be relevant to detect which species could be the most vulnerable and reveal the regions of highest stability or susceptibility to biodiversity. We aimed to: (a) assess the effect of climate change and land use on the distribution of Cerrado plant species for different countries where they occur, (b) evaluate the effectiveness of the current network of protected areas (PAs) to safeguards species under different greenhouse–gas (GHG) emissions and land use scenarios, and (c) estimate the vulnerability of species based on protection effectiveness and habitat loss. Location: Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Methods: We modelled the distribution of 1,553 plant species of Cerrado and evaluated species range loss caused by present and future land use and two GHG for 2050 and 2080. We assessed species vulnerability combining the representativeness of species within conservation units with the loss of species’ ranges outside PAs. Results: We found that climate change and land use will cause great damage to Cerrado flora by 2050 and 2080, even under optimistic conditions. The greatest impacts of land use will occur in the regions where the greatest richness will be harboured. The conservation of the species will be seriously affected since the PA network is not as effective in safeguarding them under current or future conditions. Main conclusions: The low level of protection together with the losses caused by the advance of agricultural lands will lead most species being highly vulnerable. Due to the distinct impacts of climate and land use over the three countries, conservation strategies should be implemented at transboundary and national levels.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Cerrado is considered one of the world's most threatened and floristically diverse tropical savannas. Distribution of the Cerrado flora comprises three countries: Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay; consequently, opportunities to conserve it require a transboundary effort. We aimed to (i) explore the relationship between a representative portion of Cerrado flora (8611 species), natural cover loss, and three country boundaries; and (ii) identify priority areas to expand protected areas at national and transboundary levels considering the different species conservation status, countries' governance, and natural cover loss. We modeled the distribution of Cerrado species for the three countries and overlapped species ranges with country boundaries to calculate species ranges shared between countries and the degree of endemicity. We identified national and transboundary priority regions to expand protected areas. We found that the areas with the highest plant richness are distributed in the central part of the Cerrado and Campos Rupestres Mountain Savanna ecoregions in Brazil (>8500 for the whole country). Bolivia ranked second in species richness (>4300), followed by Paraguay (>3700). The most anthropized areas in Brazil overlapped with regions predicted to foster the highest biodiversity. Conversely, such patterns were opposite in Bolivia and Paraguay, which harbored regions with high opportunities for Cerrado flora conservation. Transboundary prioritization suggested slightly higher species protection, including threatened and endemic species. Restoring some regions primarily in Brazil will be necessary to protect 30 % or 50 % of the study area. Together, the three countries can support more comprehensive conservation actions for the great diversity of the Cerrado flora.</p>

The modeling process included 9240 species initially, filtered to those with high accuracy (TSS ≥ 0.7) and adequate records (>5 occurrences), utilizing algorithms like Maximum Entropy and Random Forest, based on climate (CHELSA) and edaphic variables (SoilGrids). To address geographical overprediction, models were constrained using a minimum convex hull polygon plus a 200 km buffer. Land-use data (MapBiomas) was reclassified into natural and transformed cover to quantify the proportion of natural cover loss (anthropization) for each analysis cell.<br><br>The core method involved spatial conservation prioritization using Zonation v4 (ADMU mode 2), which ranks cells based on complementarity and irreplaceability. This analysis compared national-level prioritization against transboundary prioritization, taking into account species conservation status, governance, and land-use change. Species were categorized by endemicity degree (low, medium, high) based on their range within the study area versus the whole distribution.<br><br>### Results<br><br>Plant species richness was unevenly distributed, with the highest concentration (>8500 species) found in Brazil, particularly in the central Cerrado and Campos Rupestres Mountain Savanna. Bolivia followed with over 4300 species, and Paraguay with over 3700. A critical finding was the misalignment between biodiversity and human impact: the most anthropized areas in Brazil overlapped significantly with regions of the highest plant richness. In contrast, Bolivia and Paraguay exhibited high-biodiversity regions that presented greater opportunities for conservation due to lower natural cover loss.<br><br>Transboundary prioritization yielded superior results, providing slightly higher protection outcomes for all species, including threatened and endemic species, compared to separate national efforts. The authors concluded that achieving ambitious protection goals (30% or 50% of the study area) necessitates restoration efforts, especially in the highly degraded regions of Brazil, highlighting the combined challenge of conservation and recovery in the biome.</div>

The reliance on standard national conservation strategies often fails to optimize ecological outcomes because geopolitical units operate independently of ecological boundaries and face unique political, economic, and land-use pressures.<br><br>The geographical analysis demonstrated severe conservation challenges driven by land-use change. While Brazil harbors the greatest diversity, it also faces the most intense anthropization, necessitating large-scale restoration projects to meet conservation targets. Conversely, the less degraded portions of the biome in Bolivia and Paraguay offer immediate high-opportunity areas for effective, proactive conservation.<br><br>Ultimately, the study advocates for integrated spatial conservation planning, confirming that transboundary prioritization yields more comprehensive protection, particularly for species with restricted ranges or threatened status.

                        <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">The historical processes that explain the trans-Andean disjunct distribution of Vachellia caven (Molina) Seigler & Ebinger (formerly Acacia caven) have been a long-standing issue in South American biogeography. Based on phylogenetic studies, the genus Vachellia likely originated in the Pampa region (Argentina), implying a potential dispersal of V. caven across the Andes to Chile. In this chapter, we review and analyze the available evidence concerning the dispersal strategies of V. caven (morphological, ecological, and ethnobotanical) to assess the feasibility of the proposed trans-Andean dispersal hypotheses: vicariance, zoochory (Lama guanicoe), and human-mediated dispersal. The review suggests that vicariance is unlikely due to the relatively recent geological uplift of the Andes. Furthermore, while zoochory by the guanaco is often cited, its effectiveness as a long-distance disperser across the highest Andean passes is highly questionable, considering the specific ecological needs of the guanaco and the short gut-retention time of the seeds. Conversely, the evidence strongly supports a scenario of human-mediated long-distance dispersal (archaeophyte), likely occurring between 10,000 and 1,000 YBP, associated with indigenous migratory routes from the Argentine side. This introduction hypothesis is consistent with the archaeological records of the species in Chile, the absence of specific dispersers, and the species' strong association with ancient human settlements. This framework is essential to understand the current morphological and ecological differences across the range and has major implications for conservation management.</p>

The overall methodology involves integrating biogeographic analysis, detailed morphometric studies, niche modeling, and large-scale ecological fieldwork.<br><br>Chapter 2 focused on the biogeographic puzzle of the species' origin in Chile. Using a comprehensive review of phylogenetic, fossil, morphological, and ethnobotanical evidence, the study evaluated the likelihood of vicariance, zoochory (specifically by *Lama guanicoe*), and human-mediated dispersal. The analysis concluded that vicariance is unlikely due to the Andes' relatively recent uplift, and natural long-distance dispersal by animals like the guanaco is physiologically questionable for traversing the highest passes. The key finding was strong support for the 'human-mediated dispersal' hypothesis, suggesting *A. caven* is an archaeophyte in Chile, introduced by indigenous populations between 10,000 and 1,000 years before present (YBP) from its likely origin in the Pampa region of Argentina.<br><br>Chapter 3 employed morphometric comparison using herbaria specimens, field sampling, and a common garden experiment to assess infraspecific differentiation across the disjunct ranges and among known varieties. This work aimed to quantify the extent of divergence in traits like fruit and leaf morphology, necessary for understanding adaptation and taxonomic status.<br><br>Chapter 4 utilized Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and climatic niche analysis to predict the source area and timing of historical introduction, further reinforcing the biogeographical narrative established in Chapter 2. This chapter quantified niche overlap and assessed how the historical dispersal event influenced the current distribution.<br><br>Chapter 5 investigated the species' crucial functional role by assessing its large-scale facilitative (nurse) effects across the geographic barrier. The study calculated the Relative Interaction Index (RII) for understory communities, examining how this nurse effect varies across steep environmental gradients, particularly rainfall, and differences in plant community composition between the west and east ranges.

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The thesis provides a fundamental re-framing of the biogeographic history and ecological status of *Acacia caven* in its western distribution. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the classification of the species in Chile as an archaeophyte, stemming from a human-mediated dispersal event from the Argentine Pampas/Cuyo region. This conclusion significantly challenges narratives that might frame the species as recently invasive or lacking deep evolutionary establishment in the western range.<br><br>The research confirmed that despite its disjunct distribution and probable human introduction into Chile, the species has undergone significant morphological and niche differentiation across the Andes. This differentiation is crucial for conservation and management, suggesting that populations in the west and east are not ecologically or morphologically interchangeable.<br><br>Crucially for the context of ecological management, the thesis demonstrated that *A. caven* acts as a vital nurse species across its broad range, providing large-scale facilitative effects to associated plant communities. Chapter 5's finding of variable facilitative effects dependent on environmental stressors (like rainfall gradients) and plant community structure highlights the indispensable role of this species in ecosystem resilience and succession. The overall finding—that this species is an anciently established, ecologically functional nurse plant, irrespective of the range—has major implications for conservation, advocating for its protection and inclusion in restoration strategies rather than viewing it purely as a target for removal due to perceived woody encroachment.</div>

Rambo initially labeled *V. caven* as "nhanduvaí" and *P. affinis* as "algarrobo," despite the regional consensus that *V. caven* is the 'espinilho.'

The authors distinguish two main silvatic-campestral typologies: the *Parque de Inhanduvá*, which is associated with specific sedimentary formations (and characterizes the PEE), and the true *Parque Espinilho*, dominated by *Vachellia caven*, which is widely distributed across the state and not constrained by those formations. The article also notes the presence of Mata Ciliar and macrophyte communities within the park boundaries.</div>

O manejo inadequado da pastagem natural pode causar o aumento da freqüência de espécies nativas indesejáveis. Elas podem causar uma diminuição da produção do campo,pela da competição exercida com as plantas forrageiras de interesse, ou afetar diretamente a produção animal por causarem redução na ingestão de alimento ou mesmo efeitos tóxicos que podem, inclusive, ser letais. As espécies nativas indesejáveis, mais freqüentes no Rio Grande do Sul do ponto de vista da produção animal, são o caraguatá (Eryngium horridum Malme), a carqueja (Baccharis trimera Less.), a chirca (Eupatorium buniifolium Hook.), o mio-mio (Baccharis coridifolia DC.) e o alecrim (Vernonia nudiflora Less.). Dentre as estratégias disponíveis para controlar estas espécies podemos citar o controle mecânico, por meiode roçadas ou arraste de vigas de ferro; o controle químico, com a utilização de herbicidas; o controle biológico, por meio do pastejo, além de outras interferências que favorecem o campo nativo nas relações de competição intra-específicas, como a adubação. Algumas dessas intervenções influenciam a dinâmica da vegetação, como por exemplo o pastejo e o fogo. Obviamente , a eficácia de todos esses métodos depende das características morfofisiológicas e fenológicas, dentre as espécies. Portanto, é importante que sejam observadas as épocas corretas de utilização. Experiências demonstram que a interação entre os métodos pode promover uma maior eficiência no controle das espécies. Esta revisão tem como objetivo reunir as informações existentes sobre as principais plantas nativas indesejáveis do Rio Grande do Sul e seus métodos de controle.</p>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">This article serves as a literature review focused on identifying and detailing control strategies for five native plant species (Caraguatá, Carqueja, Chirca, Mio-mio, and Alecrim) prevalent in the natural grasslands of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) that negatively impact livestock production. The central premise is that inadequate management of natural pastures leads to an increase in the frequency of these native species.<br><br>The review characterizes the biological threats posed by each species. *Eryngium horridum* (Caraguatá) causes significant competitive loss; studies showed 40% to 70% cover reduced forage production by 43%. Control methods must target the depletion of rhizome reserves, particularly during inflorescence development. *Eupatorium buniifolium* (Chirca) also causes severe competition and shading, evidenced by reports from Argentina where its infestation reduced meat production from 90–95 kg/ha/year down to 25 kg/ha/year.<br><br>*Baccharis coridifolia* (Mio-mio) presents a different problem: extreme toxicity, rather than competition. Toxicity varies greatly based on phenology (highest during flowering, March) and sex (feminine plants are up to 32 times more toxic). Ingestion causes lethal symptoms in livestock due to macrocyclic trichothecenes. *Baccharis trimera* (Carqueja) and *Vernonia nudiflora* (Alecrim) are noted for competition and minor toxic effects, respectively.<br><br>Control strategies analyzed include:<br><br>1. **Mechanical Control:** Mowing (roçadas) or dragging heavy implements (vigas de ferro).<br>2. **Chemical Control:** Application of specific herbicides.<br>3. **Biological/Management Control:** Optimized grazing intensity (pastejo) and fertilization, aimed at favoring desired forage species over the undesirable ones. The authors emphasize that the success of any control method (including interventions like grazing and fire) is highly dependent on the correct timing, which must be aligned with the specific morphophysiological and phenological characteristics of the target species. Combining different methods is suggested to achieve optimal efficiency.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that maintaining the economic productivity and conservation value of the Campos Sulinos ecosystem requires proactive management against native species deemed undesirable from a livestock production standpoint. These species—which increase due to inadequate pasture management—reduce carrying capacity either through direct competition for resources (water, light, nutrients) or through toxicity.<br><br>Effective management necessitates a detailed understanding of the biology, phenology, and reserve accumulation points of the target species. Control methods are species-specific, and timing is crucial, for example, hitting rhizomatous plants when their reserves are lowest. While acknowledging the environmental implications of the native ecosystem, the primary focus remains on securing a favorable balance for domestic herbivore production.<br><br>Ultimately, the authors assert that sustainable production management must incorporate strategies like regulated grazing, fertilization, and, when necessary, mechanical or chemical controls, often in combination, to influence the vegetation dynamics and prevent the competitive suppression of high-value forage species. The goal of this review is to provide the necessary information base to implement these targeted control measures effectively.</div>

Os produtos utilizados, por meio de pincelamento no toco, foram o óleo diesel, óleo lubrificante usado de trator, solução aquosa de 2,4-D + picloram e solução oleosa de 2,4-D + picloram. À exceção do óleo lubrificante, os herbicidas foram testados em dois tamanhos de planta daninha e duas alturas de corte. Avaliaram-se a porcentagem de controle e o vigor de brotação das plantas não-controladas. Concluiu-se que o corte das plantas só é eficiente no controle das duas espécies, quando realizado no nível do solo e seguido da aplicação de herbicida específico, como o 2,4-D + picloram. O óleo diesel também controla totalmente ambas as espécies, e com menores custos que o 2,4-D + picloram, porém apenas quando aplicado nas plantas mais jovens. Há incompatibilidade entre o óleo diesel e o 2,4-D + picloram no controle das duas espécies. O óleo lubrificante usado não apresenta nenhum efeito herbicida em plantas adultas destas espécies.</p>

The target species are perennial shrubs common in degraded pastures, known to reduce forage productivity.<br><br>Five treatments were tested: diesel oil (pure), used engine lubricant oil (pure), 2,4-D + picloram in water (4% v/v), 2,4-D + picloram in diesel oil (4% v/v), and a control (cutting only). The herbicides (excluding lubricant oil) were tested factorially across two species, two plant sizes (smaller/younger and larger/adult), and two cutting heights (0 cm/soil level and 20 cm). Efficacy was measured by control percentage (absence of sprouting) and sprouting vigor, 90–95 days after application.<br><br>Results indicated that cutting the plants without subsequent herbicide application was generally ineffective, yielding a maximum unacceptable control of 50% for *M. pteridofita* (smaller plants cut at 0 cm) and near 0% control for *A. farnesiana*. Effective control required both cutting and chemical application.<br><br>2,4-D + picloram in aqueous solution achieved total control (100%) for both species, regardless of plant size, provided the cut was made at soil level (0 cm).

As ARLs são destinadas à manutenção da biodiversidade e podem ser manejadas de forma sustentável. Quando essas áreas abrigam ecossistemas dependentes de fogo e pastejo, como os campos nativos e as savanas, devem ser adotadas práticas de manejo adequadas à sua conservação e ao enfrentamento dos efeitos das mudanças climáticas globais. No entanto, esse assunto ainda é pouco discutido no Brasil, e as políticas públicas não são claras a esse respeito. Este artigo de revisão descreve os ecossistemas campestres e savânicos no Brasil, os aspectos legais relacionados com o manejo das ARLs, os cenários climáticos atuais e futuros, e a relação entre clima e risco de incêndios. Também apresenta uma revisão sobre o uso do fogo e do pastejo em ecossistemas campestres e savânicos, os desafios legais relativos à sua aplicação nas ARLs e o uso de geotecnologias no monitoramento destas práticas. Conclui-se que o pastejo e o fogo, como instrumentos de manejo, são adequados às funções das ARLs, desde que praticados segundo normas legais e cientificamente embasadas para evitar os efeitos negativos do seu uso equivocado.</p>

The authors establish that these open ecosystems (which include the Pampa and Cerrado) are characterized by a continuous herbaceous layer and that their evolution and maintenance are fundamentally dependent on disturbance regimes, specifically **fire and herbivory/grazing**.<br><br>Critically, the review highlights that Brazilian legislation (LPVN) lacks clarity regarding the management practices permissible within ARLs that contain non-forested vegetation, creating considerable challenges for conservation managers. The paper integrates the increasing risks posed by climate change—such as higher incidence of catastrophic fires due to increased biomass accumulation—to argue that active management is crucial. The authors emphasize that fire and grazing are not merely optional activities but are essential ecological processes that maintain biodiversity, cycle nutrients, and reduce fuel load.<br><br>Specific findings related to the Southern regions (Pampa/Campos Sulinos) note that these areas, due to their climatic regime and coexistence of tropical and winter grasses, possess an “excellent aptitude for grazing.” The authors assert that cattle ranching in the Pampa remains economically relevant and actively contributes to the maintenance of high biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics, often alongside prescribed burning practices.</div>

                            <div class="text-sm text-slate-700 prose">The authors conclude that Legal Reserve Areas (ARLs) in Brazilian grasslands and savannas, which are naturally dependent on disturbance factors like fire and grazing, require a serious shift in management policy to ensure effective conservation, especially as they face global climate change.<br><br>The central conclusion is that **grazing (pastejo) and fire are suitable management instruments for fulfilling the core functions of ARLs**, which include conserving biodiversity and rehabilitating ecological processes. However, this suitability is conditional upon these practices being strictly regulated by legal norms and scientifically grounded guidelines. The authors stress that rigorous, knowledge-based application is necessary to avoid the negative consequences associated with the misuse or inappropriate application of these powerful ecological tools. The overall goal is to promote sustainable use and ensure the long-term resilience of these open ecosystems against environmental stressors and climate extremes.</div>

Understanding their responses to such changes is crucial to predicting global carbon cycling. Important knowledge gaps exist: the causes of recent changes in tropical forest dynamics remain unclear and the responses of entire tropical trees to environmental changes are poorly understood.

However, PSPs often fail to identify the *causes* of these changes because they lack the necessary temporal resolution (remeasurement usually every 5 years) and do not allow the separation of effects from different global change factors. Understanding of physiological responses is strong at the *leaf level*, but poor at the level of the *mature tree* and the *population/community* level, particularly regarding the integrated effects of multiple stressors.<br><br>**Proposed New Research Strategy:**<br>The paper argues that major advances require a strategic shift in focus:<br>1. **Focus on Individual Trees:** Moving from leaves or entire communities to the individual tree level, where climate-induced physiological shifts translate into changes in growth or mortality.<br>2. **Focus on Long-Term Changes:** Analyzing data across multiple decades to centuries, aligning with typical tree lifespans and acclimation timescales, thereby overcoming the 'scale gap'.<br>3. **Focus on Mechanisms:** Prioritizing the understanding of causal mechanisms over merely documenting patterns of change.<br><br>**Four Key Methodological Approaches:**<br>To implement this strategy, the authors propose four underutilized methods:<br>1. **Tree-ring analyses:** To provide centennial-scale, annual-resolution data on tree growth, superior to decadal PSP data.<br>2. **Stable-isotope analyses:** Using isotopes (e.g., $\delta^{13}$C, $\delta^{18}$O, $\delta^{15}$N) from tree rings as an archive to reconstruct long-term physiological changes, such as intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE).<br>3. **Mechanistic Simulation Models:** Utilizing well-validated mechanistic tree-growth models and individual-based models to simulate tree and population responses to complex environmental changes and test hypotheses on acclimation.<br>4. **Manipulative Field Experiments:** Conducting large-scale, long-term experiments (like FACE or controlled warming/drought studies) on mature trees, which are currently lacking but are essential for testing hypotheses like $\text{CO}_2$ fertilization effects.</div>

The existing reliance on short-term, pattern-documenting approaches (like standard PSP monitoring) is insufficient for determining causality—a critical need given the profound implications for global carbon cycling and forest dieback risks.<br><br>To move forward, the field must aggressively adopt and integrate four specific, high-resolution research approaches: tree-ring dating, stable-isotope analysis, manipulative field experiments (e.g., $\text{CO}_2$ enrichment), and mechanistic simulation modeling. This integration is necessary to address the knowledge gaps at the individual tree level and link physiological responses (leaf level) to demographic outcomes (population level).<br><br>Ultimately, by focusing on individual trees, long-term historical records, and mechanistic understanding, researchers can develop more accurate forecasts of tropical forest resilience and inform necessary adaptation policies in the face of rapid global change.</div>
